This Windows 95 and Windows NT compatible program
will run on any Pentium computer or higher. If you are 
running in 256 colors mode, you will have to 
increase your screen colors to 65,000 or higher.
You can do this by right clicking the desktop or 
going to: My Computer\Control Panel\Display. 

There is a short tutorial and replay demo which
introduces you to the main features of ZIP ART.

<font size="7">FRIEDLANDER, TIMELESS LIGHTS</font> </font> 
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Master of kinetic art, his 
  light sculptures possess hypnotic powers. Brilliant and original, this Englishman 
  is also a scientist passionate about cosmology.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">p. 16<br>
  &quot;Welcome to the house of chaos.&quot; Message with a double sense. Firstly, 
  caught offhand by my early arrival, my hosts have neither had the time to change, 
  nor to clear up the toys that litter the floorboards. Secondly, it refers to 
  the movement that offered Paul Friedlander the opportunity present his sculptures 
  to the general public in 1990. He was, at that time, at the head of a group 
  of artists and scientists involved in exploring the &quot;theory of chaos&quot;, 
  advancing the hypothesis that it is always possible to meet the unexpected in 
  the middle of ordered phenomena: the famous &quot;butterfly effect&quot;, dear 
  to so many meteorologists and the &quot;determinist systems&quot; of mathematicians.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">That rapidly became complicated, 
  but better to accept that from the moment of entering: the whole Friedlander 
  universe emanates from science before becoming art. As for the hypnotic powers 
  of his sculptures, there's nothing spiritual or mystic about them. The man may 
  well dress like a hippy, have learnt the guitar &quot;to play Bob Dylan&quot; 
  and &quot;live his most intense moments in natural surrounding&quot;, his mind 
  is fed by rational things, complicated formulas and profound [p. 17] reflection 
  on the existence or not of the beginning of time. &quot;I've always had a very 
  precise idea of the 60s and 70s. I was attracted by the people because they 
  seemed more sensitive and more humane than the rest of the population, but my 
  convictions stopped me from following their ways. I was not the kind to go to 
  India to find myself or to work on an organic farm. I think I was seen at the 
  time as a kind of eccentric physicist.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">After having abandoned the 
  vast artist's studio of his beginnings on the banks of the Thames, he lives 
  today in a rather chic residential area of London. His work space, curiously 
  similar to that of a carpenter, is contained in corner of the living room. Certainly, 
  an enormous opening in the ceiling, right through to that of the second floor, 
  allows him to construct sculpture 6 metres high. But otherwise the house is 
  largely and joyfully occupied by everyday life, and notably by his youngest 
  daughter Natam, one and a half years old, that Paul is bringing up with his 
  companion Voravanna, a designer, expert in light installations. &quot;Children 
  need time, tolerance, trust and certain occasions for playing and being creative. 
  We are against restrictions.&quot; His two older children, Naomi and Jack, from 
  an earlier union, benefited from the same education. Paul Friedlander also, 
  incidentally, but he has mixed feelings about his own childhood. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
  As a child, he dreamed of space travel</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Precocious child, he very 
  early felt &quot;different from the others and from the world in general&quot;. 
  &quot;At home it didn't matter; my parents always understood me and defended 
  my right to be different. At school, on the other hand, it was very hard. My 
  class mates found me strange; I had few interests in common with them. It was 
  also there that I first came onto conflict with the authorities: I refused to 
  participate in the morning prayer, it had no sense for me.&quot; Escape came 
  in the form of cosmology, dreams of stars and constructions of space crafts 
  in the family garden in Cambridge. &quot;My dreams of space travel and physics 
  are deeply rooted in me and have inspired my whole way of living&quot;. </font></p>

  Oldest of three children, he was the only one to accompany his parents to the 
  States at the age of two. His father Gerard, brilliant mathematician, was invited 
  there as researcher by the University of New York. By the return journey, taken 
  aboard the Queen Mary, Paul Friedlander was fully converted to &quot;large and 
  mechanical things&quot; such as he'd discovered on the other side of the Atlantic. 
  Nothing astonishing then that this revelation would lead to his making sculptures 
  of up to 13 metres high. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
  In ecstasy before the works of Nicolas Sch&ouml;ffer</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Having excelling in maths 
  and physics in secondary school, Friedlander continued this discipline at university 
  level. His passion for cosmology found itself troubled by the Big bang theory. 
  &quot;I preferred, and still prefer, the model of constant creation. I'm an 
  optimist and can't resign myself the idea that time has a beginning. Time is 
  eternal; there can't be a beginning and an end&quot;. The Big Bang idea disturbed 
  him to such an extent that he hesitated before the idea of pursuing a scientific 
  career. An exhibition in London just at that moment struck him with great force, 
  clarifying everything, in all senses.....</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;That day, I had gone 
  to see an exhibition in the Hayward Gallery, entitled &quot;Kinetics&quot;. 
  I was 20 and it changed my life. The works of Nicolas Sh&ouml;ffer left me ecstatic. 
  I went home knowing what I wanted to do with my life and I put myself to it 
  straight away. After the lectures, I worked on kinetics.&quot; His fascination 
  for the father of cybernetic art has remained unchanged. To this day, he maintains 
  a precious contact with the French artist's widow, El&eacute;onore. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">University over, he immediately 
  started studying art - a bitterly disappointing experience. He found the professors 
  &quot;not very intelligent&quot;, regretted the emergence of conceptualism as 
  the only &quot;real&quot; art and failed to understand that the world should 
  be governed by &quot;fashions rather than by the beauty of things&quot;. The 
  diploma obtained, he left for London, installing himself in a disused hangar 
  and surrounding himself with other artists. There he invented objects for commercial 
  uses, and more often than had his ideas stolen. From there he moved into the 
  world of theatrical productions and [p.20] concerts where he made his living 
  doing the lighting (sorry can't remember if there's a more professional way 
  of saying it!). He invented new procedures, experimented with different techniques, 
  but suffered from the restrictions imposed on him. Then, at 36, he abandoned 
  everything and finally consecrated himself entirely to kinetic art. </font></p>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
  &quot;Parallel worlds exist&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The &quot;Chaos&quot; experience 
  constituted the real starting point of his artistic career. Exhibitions and 
  commissions, distinctions and conferences duly followed. He was invited to the 
  MIT in order to present his work, accomplishing thus a childhood dream. Since 
  2002, his name has been listed in Who's Who and his computer programs, downloadable 
  from this web site, are extremely successful. &quot;I learnt programming late, 
  by myself, and it's something I love. I use it to create, but also for the simple 
  pleasure of making software&quot;. To see him rushing about the house in search 
  of the black-out curtains essential for bringing his sculptures to life and 
  to then see the difficulty he has turning off his creations, one would imagine 
  that he lives 100% for his art. Nothing could be farther from the truth. No 
  sooner has one turned around, than he's skipping through the last number of 
  a scientific review to see that his article has been published. He thinks that 
  in a year's time, he and a few other scientists will be able to talk with the 
  future. &quot;Realistically, I may be able to receive a phone call from myself 
  in the future. Certain recent facts support the possibility very seriously. 
  It implies the existence of parallel worlds, but of that, I've already been 
  persuaded for a long time.&quot; To be considered crazy doesn't bother him. 
  &quot;I'm profoundly rational, but I also know that very many things remain 
  inexplicable. We can't have an answer to everything, even in those domains where 
  logic reigns. Luckily. Because, not knowing, it's what helps us to progress...&quot;</font></p>

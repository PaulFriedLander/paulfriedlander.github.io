<h2>Acrylic Sculptures</h2>
<div><img src="../../../images/2021/Acrylic Sculptures/5338.jpg" width="100%" vspace="24" /></div>
<div>Like everyone else in the World, COVID brought changes for me.</div>
<div><img src="../../../images/2021/Acrylic Sculptures/5340.jpg" width="100%" vspace="24" /></div>
<div>I took a pause, I stopped making art.</div>
<div><img src="../../../images/2021/Acrylic Sculptures/0900.jpg" width="100%" vspace="24" /></div>
<div>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>A little while later, adjusted to working for myself and with no shows possible, I began a process of reflection.</p>
</div>
<div><img src="../../../images/2021/Acrylic Sculptures/5349.jpg" width="100%"  vspace="24" /></div>
<div>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Some years ago I had made some small experiments with engraving on acrylic.</p>
</div>
<div><img src="../../../images/2021/Acrylic Sculptures/5451.jpg" width="100%"  vspace="24"  /></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To start with I thought of these as little more than sketches, maquettes or models. </p>
<div><img src="../../../images/2021/Acrylic Sculptures/5516.jpg" width="100%"  vspace="24"  /></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Perhaps with some new tech I could animate the forms or change the colours. </p>
<div><img src="../../../images/2021/Acrylic Sculptures/5523.jpg" width="100%"  vspace="24"  /></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Individual pieces are small, typically no more than half a metre high. </p>
<div><img src="../../../images/2021/Acrylic Sculptures/1022.jpg" width="100%"  vspace="24"  /></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gradually a  collection grew, they developed a stronger presence. </p>
<div><img src="../../../images/2021/Acrylic Sculptures/0642.jpg" width="100%"  vspace="24"  /></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I assembled a display in my studio, bringing together pieces from 2015 with recent works. </p>
<div><img src="../../../images/2021/Acrylic Sculptures/0702.jpg" width="100%"  vspace="24"  /></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My decision to look again at the acrylics was triggered by the frustration of not being able to do large shows, but their was another dynamic at play. </p>
<div><img src="../../../images/2021/Acrylic Sculptures/4037.jpg" width="100%"  vspace="24"  /></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The designs were created in software I wrote originally for   real time video animation. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div><img src="../../../images/2021/Acrylic Sculptures/0737.jpg" width="100%"  vspace="24"  /></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was beginning to become aware there was a lot more in the software  than I first realised.</p>
<div></div>
<div><img src="../../../images/2021/Acrylic Sculptures/3501.jpg" width="100%"  vspace="24"  /></div>
<div>
  <p>Many of the designs were made on flat pieces of material but they began to take on a three dimensional presence. </p>
<p><img src="../../../images/2021/Acrylic Sculptures/5047.jpg" width="100%"  />
  I was learning new ways of working with the software I had written long ago.</p>
<p><img src="../../../images/2021/Acrylic Sculptures/3747.jpg" width="100%"  /> 
  </p>
<p>The inspiration had been a 'virtual ripple tank', a student physics experiments once popular to demonstrate the principle of wave interference. </p>
<p><img src="../../../images/2021/Acrylic Sculptures/3102.jpg" width="100%"  />  
  </p>
<p>Free of the need to follow the laws of physics, I could tweak the mathematics to my artistic ends. <img src="../../../images/2021/Acrylic Sculptures/3258.jpg" width="100%"  /> 
  </p>
<p>At times errors produced strange zones that had a particular character.</p>
<p> <img src="../../../images/2021/Acrylic Sculptures/3331.jpg" width="100%"  /> 
  A series of images looked like aliens.
  </p>
<p><img src="../../../images/2021/Acrylic Sculptures/3412.jpg" width="100%"  />  
  </p>
<p>I added the suggestion of stars. </p>
<p><img src="../../../images/2021/Acrylic Sculptures/Owl.jpg" width="100%"  />  
  </p>
<p>Perhaps there was a group trying to contact me?</p>
<p> <img src="../../../images/2021/Acrylic Sculptures/L-O.jpg" width="100%"  /> 
  </p>
<p>With the prospect of a lasting end to lockdown and the chance for a show, I decided to start on  larger works. <img src="../../../images/2021/Acrylic Sculptures/1220.jpg" width="100%"  />Some more than a metre wide or tall.  
  <img src="../../../images/2021/Acrylic Sculptures/0657.jpg" width="100%"  />  
  <img src="../../../images/2021/Acrylic Sculptures/0622.jpg" width="100%"  /> 
  <img src="../../../images/2021/Acrylic Sculptures/2947.jpg" width="100%"  /> 
  <img src="../../../images/2021/Acrylic Sculptures/0607.jpg" width="100%"  />  
  <img src="../../../images/2021/Acrylic Sculptures/3928.jpg" width="100%"  />

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>BLACK AND WHITE AND PSYCHEDELIC 
  ALL OVER:</b></font> These six wheels have been painted in boring black and 
  white, but your eyes will beg to differ. Blending science and art, British light 
  sculptor and computer artist Paul Friedlander created &quot;The Spinners&quot;. 
  When rotated quickly enough, the wheels appear to the human eye - and the camera 
  - as a kinetic riot of colours. The sculpture is one of 22 works by the artist 
  on show at The Wave Machines, an exhibition at the Singapore Science Centre 
  from Oct 5 to Jan 6 next year. Seven of Mr Friedlander's light sculptures will 
  hang from the 25 m high ceiling of the exhibition hall. The Science Centre yesterday 
  organsed a talk for students to explain the science behind some of the exhibits.</p>

<h3>Spinning Cosmos
</h3>
<p>On the 4th of October 1957, Sputnik 1  was launched. I was 6 years old and it was  the first piece of news on the TV I truly understood and felt deeply moved  about. I was a child of the Space Age and I became fascinated with space travel  and everything about space. By the time I was in my teens, along with designing  my own interstellar starships, I had a serious interest in astronomy and a love  affair with cosmology but my first passion was to prove brief and disappointing  because I fell for the wrong theory. At the time two theories were competing  and I preferred the Steady State, which proposed an eternal universe with no  beginning or end to time. In 1965 the crucial piece of evidence was discovered,  the cosmic background radiation, that confirmed the Big Bang and disproved my  favourite theory. Since then I have continued to follow cosmology with great  interest but always with an eye for how things may be changing and whether any cracks  are showing in the winning theory, which I never could feel entirely comfortable  about. Over the passing decades, observations have improved immensely and  important advances have occurred but nothing has altered the basic picture of  expansion being the main way the universe as a whole moves. Nothing at least  until now. It is perhaps hard for me to convey the excitement I felt when I  first read of the discovery of cosmic spin, I felt like dancing in the street.  No, it would not directly undermine the Big Bang, but I sensed right away it  certainly would put theorists in the hot seat trying to accommodate it within  their ideas. But perhaps I am rushing ahead too fast, let me go back to the  beginning of cosmology.<br />
  <br />
  The Ancients knew the universe was spinning around the Earth  but Copernicus proposed an alternative  explanation, the Earth was moving. Today we are certain that Earth's place is  not unique,  earth like planets could  exist all over the universe but a shadow of doubt has crept into the question  of whether the universe is spinning. Physicist Professor Michael Longo at the  University of Michigan at Ann Arbor had the idea to check and he did this by  getting a team of 5 graduate students to look at over 200,000 photos of spiral  galaxies. Any astronomer or cosmologist would have told him not to waste his  and their time: the number spinning clockwise compared with those spinning  anticlockwise should be more or less the same and any variation entirely down  to statistical fluctuation. Their confidence is based on the  cosmological principle that asserts that on the large scale the universe must  be homogeneous and isotropic. This means that our universe is like a well  stirred mixture.  If  we point a powerful telescope in one  direction and photograph distant galaxies and then repeat the procedure looking  in the opposite direction, we are looking at two regions perhaps 20 billion  light years apart yet they look more or less the same. The shapes and sizes of  the galaxies and how far apart they are from their neighbours cannot be  distinguished. Observationally it is established beyond doubt that the universe  is homogeneous  but it not so easy to  confirm isotropy, that they have no alignment   or preferred direction. Distant galaxies look like very faint misty smudges  even in the finest telescopes.<br />
  <br />
  Confidence in the cosmological  principle arises from a long history of improving observations with ever better  telescopes and increasingly good confirmation of just how 'smooth' the universe  is when considered on a suitably huge scale. It is recognised that galaxies  tend to form into clusters which themselves group into super clusters but this  process has an upper bound. There has been no hint that the grouping process  continues indefinitely, indeed it is believed to be impossible. The universe  was created in a near perfectly smooth well stirred state and there simply has  not been enough time since it formed for structures much larger than a few  hundred million light years across to have formed. At least that is  conventional wisdom. Longo's study already covered a  region of space reaching out to 1.2 billion light years, which is larger  than the limit to vastness set by the by the  cosmological principle and now another researcher, Lior Shamir of the Lawrence  Technological University at Southfield, Michigan , has carried out another  survey looking at galaxies even further away using a computer to automatically  analyse their images. He is also confident there is  an overall spin and his results come with 40  fold increased statistical significance. But there is a catch, the axis he  finds his galaxies to be aligned along is 70 degrees away from  the one that Longo found. What are we to make  of this? Are they both completely mistaken? Or perhaps the errors are larger  than they realise and the true axis lies somewhere between those reported? Both  are possible.<br />
  <br />
  In science beautiful ideas have a nasty  tendency to fall foul to ugly facts. Before continuing with cosmic spin I want  to talk more about the Big Bang. In my mind this was such an ugly fact and now  let me explain why. Time having a beginning is only part of the problem. Every  known law of physics breaks down at or very close to the moment of creation. The  instant of creation is like dividing by zero in arithmetic which is not  allowed. Take any number and divide by zero, the answer is always infinite. At  time zero many terms go to infinity, temperature, density, etc. Worse still  space and time themselves become infinitely distorted and breakdown. What does  this mean? No one is quite sure but they have a name for it: a singularity. If  an infinity ever crops up in any more routine science, the normal reaction of a  scientist is at once to consider the calculations to be invalid. She or he  needs to find a different way to do the calculations or  it is time to go and make more observations to  find out what is really going on. <br />
  <br />
  Can cosmology be different to  every other science? Space appears to be infinitely large, although we can only  observe an infinitesimally small region of this and the Big Bang is full of all  kinds of infinities. Are we really just to accept this? I have doubts.  Cosmology should be like other sciences where ideas are tested by experiment or  observation and up to a point that is what is going on: all the time  astronomers improve their observations and  cosmologists adjust their theories to agree  with those facts.  Theoretical physicists studying  fundamental forces also have a problem with unwanted infinities, in their case  just considering what would happen if you could get really close to a  fundamental particle, say an electron, then surely its electric field should  increase towards infinity just at this central point. They have long since  found a mathematical work around to this problem but the suspicion remains that  it is something of a fudge and fundamental particles cannot really be  infinitely small and therefore are not truly particles but must have some shape  and size. The preferred shape is string like, hence the idea of String Theory.<br />
  <br />
  In recent years both cosmologists  and physicists studying string theory have been leaning more and more towards  the view that there is a multi-verse, a multiplicity of universes. The  cosmologists arrived at the idea after concluding that the Big Bang far from  being unique is something that is happening all the time and perhaps an  infinite number of times but in locations vastly more remote than the  furthest  galaxy we could ever hope to see. While string  theorists got there by a completely different route, they concluded that there  appear to be a vast number of possible forms the laws of physics can take and  since there was nothing apparently to choose between them, then all these  possible laws must be true somewhere in some other universe. They refer to this  idea as the  Landscape. <br />
  <br />
More cautious physicists are unconvinced  by these ideas  as it appears problematic  to find evidence to support them. Working with mathematics alone has lead  science far beyond the point where any evidence might  ever be collected to prove these ideas are  real. There is no expectation that we will find some science fiction style  gateway to the other  universes. They  remain remote unconfirmed conjecture.   Theoreticians have gone out on a limb from which they may never return. I  would like a new discovery so theory can reconnect with experiment and  observation. Cosmic spin just might be just what we need.<br />
<br />
  Nikodem Poplawski of Indiana  University at Bloomington has an explanation for the Big Bang with no  infinities,  the universe is inside a  black hole. His universe starts very hot, but not infinitely hot. Likewise all  the other infinities are tamed.  Lee  Smolin of the Perimeter Institute in Ontario proposed that universes might  form inside black holes some years ago.  Poplawski 's work builds on this idea and he points out that black holes observed  by astronomers spin so a universe inside a black hole should also spin. Longo's  discovery maybe the first piece of evidence that the universe is inside a black  hole. And if it is inside a black hole, then we can be sure at least one other  universe exists, the one in which the black hole that formed our universe sits.  From that point it might seem reasonable to expect many and possibly an  infinite number of universes to exist. I am reminded though of an episode of  the cartoon Futurama , set a thousand years in the future, where they go off to  visit the restaurant at the end of the universe. A discussion ensues amongst  the protagonists about how ancient astronomers once thought there might be an  infinite number of universes, but it turned out there were only two, and you  could get a fine view of the other one from the restaurant at the end of the  universe, another restaurant, looking exactly the same looking back at them,  two old time American diners floating in a black void.<br />
  <br />
  Even if the universal direction  of spin is confirmed there will be an immense amount of further work needed  before any apparently crazy notion like living inside a black hole can be  confirmed. Perhaps this research will all turn out to be a mirage but  alternatively the Spinning Cosmos may come to be seen as the key discovery that  marks the beginning of the new physics and cosmology of the 21st century. More and  better observations are needed and they are going to come from South America.  In several years time, the future Large Synoptic Survey will begin at a new  observatory being designed that will be built in Chile. It will eventually image  about 10 billion galaxies, around 20 times more than currently known. <br />

  After first reading about cosmic  spin I at once I wrote to Michael Longo and was delighted that he responded  positively. I proposed to create a light installation on the theme and he most  kindly made available his data, a list of over 25,000 galaxies drawn from the  over 200,000 that had been studied. These were   the 'hits' that showed a direction of spin in their spiral pattern.  This data was extracted from The Sloan  Digital Sky Survey. This is an amazing modern day oracle that anyone is free to  visit, a website containing data and photographs of millions of galaxies. But  like the oracles of old it may be hard to interpret the meaning in its  pronouncements. Longo has found a pattern in this vast body of information. I  have attempted to give artistic expression to this not by faithfully  reproducing the appearance of the sky, but rather by treating this knowledge  as a source of inspiration to create my  Spinning Cosmos. The  galaxy data has  been included in the installation along with sculptural  ideas, both virtual and real inspired by the  discovery . The data is used to draw the positions  of all the galaxies in a 3D map and the data,  which is all stored as strings of numbers is also displayed 'as is', seemingly  endless lists of numbers, catalogue numbers, records of positions in the sky,  red shifts, etc. The kind of information that once filled nautical almanacs  that real navigators had to read today are now rarely seen as computes process  them automatically but I felt it would be appropriate the numbers are put in  the installation alongside the galaxies that they are telling us about. <br />
  <br />
For many years my art has  involved the use of spinning in creating kinetic sculptures  but I never guessed that spinning  might turn out to be so important to  cosmology and so little understood. Let there be spin!</p>

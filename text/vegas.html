  for an Animation on the Worlds <br>
  Largest Lighting Display</font><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
  </font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Fremont 
  Street Experience is a street in the centre of Las Vegas which has been converted 
  to a pedestrian precinct by building a long glass arch between the buildings 
  from one side of the street to the other. Four blocks have been roofed over, 
  a distance of about a third of a mile. Attached to the underside of the arch 
  is a canopy of over two million lights, arranged to form a giant screen. Every 
  hour throughout the evening there is <img src="../images/rendered1.jpg" width="240" height="345" align="right" vspace="16" hspace="16" alt="Something Else">a 
  brief spectacular show.</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The City 
  of Las Vegas Arts Commission have called for light artists to make proposals 
  for the design an animation. This is an extract from my proposal, together with 
  the pictures I have submitted. PC users can download a 3D program, which shows 
  what it might be like. On the right is a screen shot from the Vegas program. 
  The waves are fully animated and you can control their colour and form and fly 
  through the simulation. The down load is a 400 Kb self extracting zip file. 
  This program was written in a hurry, it is not bug free. It cannot do any harm 
  to your computer but it may crash. It will not alter your registry and can easily 
  be deleted. It is only recommended for machines of 500 MHz or higher.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I propose 
  an animation which simulates my kinetic light sculptures. The long canopy of 
  lights over peoples heads is ideally shaped to display images depicting the 
  luminous forms created by the spinning strings of my light sculptures. We are 
  not limited to one gigantic string stretching the entire length of Fremont Street, 
  although this will certainly be the most breathtaking of sights. We can simulate 
  a handful, a hundred or a myriad of smaller strings, all whirling each in their 
  own individual dance.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">While physical 
  light sculptures use chromastrobic light created by a system of computer controlled 
  colour and shutter wheels spinning at high speed in front of high powered lights, 
  for this proposal, the effects of chromastrobic light can be simulated and in 
  so doing, a remarkable further development becomes possible. It has for a long 
  time been my ambition that the colours of the chromastrobic lights should not 
  be simply beautiful but convey information or tell a story in their own right. 
  Now at last it is possible. </font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The story 
  I wish to tell happens right here in Las Vegas under this canopy of lights. 
  I call it The Kiss. If people do not know that there is a story being told, 
  it does not matter, for them the animation will be like a firework display, 
  but for those who want to know how the animation was structured, here is my 
  story. </font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I imagine 
  two people recognising each other from far away along the length of this extraordinary 
  space: a man and a woman. They met before, but only fleetingly and long ago. 
  Now at the sight of each other in this setting, they become carried away by 
  their emotions. The colours of the display will be selected from the colours 
  of our two protagonists and their surroundings. We can show first an overview, 
  a confusing jumble of many movements, light and colour from the whole crowd 
  milling around. Then by stages our selection becomes more specific, first identifying 
  the <img src="../images/heryes.jpg" width="203" height="291" align="right" vspace="16" hspace="16" alt="Her Eyes">two 
  individuals, showing their full figures, then focussing in closer still on their 
  faces. At each stage, the light and colours will be sampled and used to control 
  the colours of the animation. As the man and woman come closer together, we 
  sense their excitement at recognising each other, their haste to get closer 
  as they push through the crowd. We show again the flashing colours of the scene 
  around and then finally we focus on the fine detail. His eyes, as blue as a 
  perfect sky, hers as dark as a tropical night, glinting with stars reflecting 
  the many lights around her. Finally they come together and embrace. The moment 
  of their kiss is the climax where we use the flesh tones of face and lips to 
  colour the explosion of kinetic forms which bring this sequence to an end. <img src="../images/10000kisses.jpg" width="262" height="478" align="left" vspace="16" hspace="16" alt="A Thousand Kisses"></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">At no time 
  during the animation are the images of the two individuals ever shown, instead 
  the qualities of light and colour from this scene form the palette for the light 
  display. The story is told in the abstract, but the feelings will be strong. 
  Like seeing the Northern Lights for the first time or listening to strange magical 
  music, an evocative tune played in an unknown key. The actual music accompanying 
  this light show will be provided by Laurie Spiegel, a friend and noted contemporary 
  American composer. She is the founder of generative music, her compositions, 
  based on computer algorithms she has developed, perfectly mirrors the abstract 
  beauty of my light sculptures. </font></p>

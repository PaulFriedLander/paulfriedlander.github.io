Ancient walled cities often have markets outside their major gates. In Jerusalem, 
for example, a market is still to be found outside Damascus Gate, the most important 
gate of the Old City. Roman London had six gates: Ludgate, Newgate, Aldersgate, 
Cripplegate, <span class=GramE>Bishopsgate <span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>and</span> Aldgate. The walls stood for over 
a thousand years, being added to and partly rebuilt during that time. Bishopsgate 
leading out to the Old North Road, also known as Ermine Street, was one of the 
most important gates as it opened to a major route. Spitalfields was established 
in the mid 17th century a short distance outside the City wall close to the Old 
North Road and Bishopsgate. At that time the walls were still intact and it was 
not until nearly 100 years later in 1760 that most of the walls and Bishopsgate 
were demolished.</font></span><font size="+1"><span style='font-family:"Verdana","sans-serif"'></span></font></font>

  a computer program and transforming them to stainless steel. If I could build

mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>We often find clocks over gateways; it is part of what 
  we might expect. The clock face in the City Gate is going to be a real working 
  clock, but not one you could easily read. It will be a challenge to those who 
  like cryptic puzzles. I imagined another civilisation in a parallel universe 
  that split from our world sometime around or shortly after the era of ancient 
  Greece. Their planet was the same as ours up until that <span class=GramE>point</span> 
  and we share our ancient histories. I call them the Binarians. <img src="Spitalfields_2010_files/clockface_2.jpg" width="516" height="415" align="right" hspace="16"><o:p></o:p></span></font></p>

  </span>As a consequence there are strong similarities and also striking differences 
  in the way their clocks work. They live on a planet that orbits its sun in the 
  same number of days. They have 12 months in a year since their Moon is like 
  ours. Their calendar and even the way they divide the day is like ours. The 
  length of the year was first discovered long ago, at least as far back as ancient 
  Babylon. The Egyptians invented hours and the Babylonians invented minutes and 
  seconds. All these ideas we share with the Binarians. Where we differ is in 
  our counting systems. We refer to our numbers as Arabic numerals. Not strictly 
  true, since our number system was invented in India some time after our separation 
  from Binaria. The idea travelled to the West via Arabia. <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>

mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>Following the 
  design of the Rosetta stone, I have invented three Binarian counting systems, 
  The Ancient, the Emergent and the Modern. Having<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>three different systems will be a help if you 
  are intent on solving the puzzle by comparing the symbols, just as the Rosetta 
  stone once provided the key to understanding hieroglyphics. I will give some 
  clues. The prominent Greek ‘equation’ of the Ancient system will prove the hardest 
  to interpret, the smaller characters underneath will be your starting point.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  
  </span>When you think you have solved the mystery, you can confirm by checking 
  the year showing on the calendar. The Binarians count their years from the birth 
  of Pythagoras. The clock in the model is not showing the current time. I recorded 
  some random minutes in December. When it is complete, the City Gate will show 
  time accurately. I have already written the code for the clock, but I could 
  not load the program into the media player I have used in the maquette on exhibition 
  here.</span></font></p>

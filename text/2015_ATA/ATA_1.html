<p><strong>Transcript  of video</strong><br />
  <br />
I have created in an ephemeral form something that appears  for a brief time, rapidly changing and with no way to preserve its transient  beauty except as imperfect video or freeze as photographic images.</p>
<p> <br />
My dream is to create a new media, transparent and luminous,  floating in the air.  The slower forms  would persist, their shapes remaining the same while their colours would  continue to change.</p>
<p><br />
What can be achieved with today&rsquo;s technology is transparency  and luminosity, but with the need to accept certain constraints on the variety  of sculptural form.</p>
<p><br />
EARTH SIGNALS, the project I propose for ATA shall float  like signposts on a journey into the unknown. </p>
<p><br />
Each sign, about the size of a large tablet, shall be formed  of two sheets of tempered glass or abrasion resistant clear plastic and  sandwiched between these shall be a transparent display formed of thousands of  tiny leds mounted on a transparent circuit board.</p>
<p><br />
The smallest full colour leds, equipped with three phosphors  and capable of shining with any colour are only half by half millimetre. So  small that when viewed from a distance they merge together like pixels on a  screen.</p>
<p> <br />
  My plan is not to fill the entire circuit but instead to  preserve the transparency by drawing contour lines spaced well apart formed of  thousands of leds, each surface mounted and sitting so close to its neighbours  on the contour they shall appear like continuous lines. </p>
<p><br />
  The opening animation goes slightly beyond what we can  currently achieve, instead when viewed close up each sign shall appear more  like these last images where I have simulated close up views of leds. In  reality each led would be identical, spread at regular intervals along their  lines.</p>

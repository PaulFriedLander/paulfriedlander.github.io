<H3>	Light is the closest we come to directly sensing the universal
energy. The chance interplay of form and color can inspire awe and wonder.</H3> <P>

	In the past I divided my time between kinetic art and stage work. <P>
My stage lighting focused on electro-acoustic music culminating in a series 
of concerts in the mid 80's with the Electric Symphony Orchestra. 
</P>
These spectacular concerts were a carte blanche 
for me to expand my stage designs. The light shows created for these 
events were charged with the energy of rock music, but still maintained a 
distinct sobriety. <IMG SRC="../images/orches01.jpg" WIDTH=306 HEIGHT=230 HSPACE=16 VSPACE=16 ALIGN=right>

<P> The illustration on the left below is from the Almeida Festival in 1985.

The illustration on the left above  and on the right shows an ESO concert presented at the Queen Elizabeth hall at the London South Bank Arts Complex in 1987.
<P>
This was to be one of the last concerts I lit. I wanted to free myself from the restrictions of being 
under the control of a director so I decided to focus on kinetic art: a subject in which I could bring together my divided background and combine my knowledge of physics with my love of light.

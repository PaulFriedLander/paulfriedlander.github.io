      <font size="-1"><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As swell as 
      admiring artist Paul Friedlander's amazing light sculptures, visitors to 
      Nutopia can park their posteriors on Ansel Thomas' highly original 'Sofa 
      For Two'- a piece of furniture which, according to Nutopia's spokes person 
      Roz Airatoon: &quot;explores the interface between organic structures and 
      new advances IT' material and structural technologies.&quot; The artist 
      himself commented that: &quot;the sofa is constructed using similar technology 
      to that of a Formula 1 car.&quot;<br>
      This month, Nutopia will also be exhibiting the work of digital artist Jason 
      Bruges. Jason has constructed eight interactive panels, which breathe blue 
      and white light and respond to ambient changes in the atmosphere, including 
      human movement. Nutopia Is looking for digital art and installations to 
      exhibit in its gallery. For more information, contact Toula Philippakou 
      (Nutopia's operations Director and George's sister) on 10207 379 3730. Or 
      feel free to ask for her in person at the lounge's reception area.</font></b></font></td>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
  Whether you live in London, or have the opportunity to visit on digitally creative 
  business, you should go to a unique new cyberspace: Nutopia. Set just a stones 
  throw from the hustle and bustle of Covent Garden's Piazza, Nutopia is a friendly 
  mix of interactive rnedia art space, chill-out zone and computer laboratory 
  - picture a set frorn Kubrick's 2001 (minus the lippy computer Hal) and you'll 
  get the idea.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
  <b><font size="+1">From coffee to art</font></b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">At the front of Nutopia are comfy 
  sofas and an organic juice/coffee bar, from where you can feast your eyes on 
  cutting-edge art which, even if it doesn't actually emanate from computer monitors, 
  relies on computer power to drive it.</font></p>

  Currently on show is 'Dark Matter', a sculpture from Britain's leading light 
  artist, Paul Friedlander. Paul shines chrornastrobic light along the length 
  of three rapidly gyrating skipping ropes, which give rise to three oscillating 
  vertical columns of textured light. The form and colour of these columns are 
  continuously redefined by a hidden computer. Better still, you can interact 
  with 'Dark Matter' by using two high-frequency sound beams to alter the speed 
  of the rope's vibrations and the colour of light. Place some part of your body 
  through the beams and you cause disturbances that are fed back to the motor, 
  driving the rope into the chromastrobe to illuminate the sculpture.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Move on through Nutopia and you pass 
  the two huge aquariums which have been installed to de-ionise the air, helping 
  to create both a calm and stress-free </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">environment. 
  Computer-controlled aquamarine lighting is carefully used throughout the space, 
  giving you the impression of living in some seductive, subtly changing, digital 
  artwork.<br>
  At the back is a 'Computer Zone', with rows of clinically white Starship Enterprise 
  benches, all laden with beautiful iMac low-radiation monitors. In a curious 
  hybrid of digital technology, these Macs are actually the front ends of PC-based 
  systems powered by Intel Pentium chips. Purists who believe that 'never the 
  twain shall meet' shouldn't be put off; these Mac-Intel hybrids function with 
  spooky smoothness and are remarkably user-friendly.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> <b><font size="+1">Ambitious plans</font></b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Nutopia is very much in its embryonic 
  phase, but Managing Director Grant Mitchell and IT Director George Philippakos 
  both believe that &quot;The sky is the limit&quot;. So what, exactly, do these 
  two have up their sleeves?</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">With the calm assurance of a new 
  age prophet who knows he's on to a good thing, Mitchell envisages: &quot;a worldwide 
  network of Nutopias, an interactive on-line database for computer artists and 
  people working in new media or the hot technology industries, and an exhibition 
  demonstrating the latest in robot technology - that's just for startersl&quot;

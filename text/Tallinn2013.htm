      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Plan A had been to 
        be the very first event to take place at The Culture Hub, an old power 
        station down close to the water front of this harbour city that is being 
        converted to an arts centre. Things did not work out as the builders restoring 
        the place were running behind schedule and at the last minute I was notified 
        that the venue had been switched. I found myself instead setting up in 
        a derelict cinema, The Helios, right in the heart of the old quarter.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It turned out to be 
        a great place to work. It was large with enough space for two installations. 
        At the end of the room, (on the left above) is <i>Abstract Cosmology,</i> 
        first shown at the Reina Sofia Museum in Madrid in 2008. Along the side, 
        the new installation, <i>An Alternative Approach to Unifying String Theory 
        with the Standard Model of Particles</i>. I chose the name partially because 
        I knew that with the Higgs boson now a well established fact, physicists 
        are beginning to wonder what will come next. Finding evidence in support 
        of String theory would be much the most exciting thing.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There was also a certain 
        sense of tongue in cheek. One can draw a parallel between physics and 
        my work. String Theory conjectures that all forms of matter are different 
        ways that 'fundamental string' oscillates. I have long been fascinated 
        by waves on a string and use them in some of my artworks. While elementary 
        particles can be described by a very short list of properties, their mass, 
        the forces by which they interact with other particles and their spin. 
        Almost all my kinetic artworks spin. Interestingly however the Higgs is 
        the first non spinning fundamental particle to be discovered. As it happens 
        I am working on some non spinning art forms. One is hand held, photos 
        below, the other exists only as software at the moment. You can view a high resolution video

        of some curious and previously unknown properties of mirrors.</font></p>

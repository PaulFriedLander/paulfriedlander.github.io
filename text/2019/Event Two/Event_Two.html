<h2>EVENT TWO 2019, Royal College of Art, London</h2>
<p>Organised by CAS in association with FLUX Events and other arts organisations.</p>

  <p>The computer  Arts Society was founded in 1968. The three founder members of the Society –  Alan Sutcliffe, George Mallen, and John Lansdown – had been involved with  computing and its related concepts for some time. They knew Jasia Reichardt,  the curator of Cybernetic Serendipity (1968) and had participated in or advised  on aspects of the exhibition. Sutcliffe was involved with the exhibition  through his collaboration with composer Peter Zinovieff and Electronic Music  Studios (EMS). Mallen was working with the English cybernetician Gordon Pask at  Systems Research and assisted on the production of the interactive robotic work  Colloquy of Mobiles shown at the exhibition. Sutcliffe brought the paper tape  of a music program he had written at ICL to Zinovieff to &ldquo;realise&rdquo; and thus  began their collaboration, with Sutcliffe assisting the Studio by writing  software for the synthesizers they produced. Zinovieff is recognised as having  revolutionised electronic and avant-garde music and EMS was used by Sir  Harrison Birtwistle, Stockhausen and Pink Floyd among others. In 1969, the  Computer Arts Society organised their first public exhibition at the Royal  College of Art naming the show Event One. <br />
    </p>
  <p>CAS chairman, Nick Lambert and Graham Diprose decided  to celebrate 50 years of the society with a return to the RCA to present Event  Two from the 12th – 17th July 2019. Event Two has been organised through a  newly emergent network connecting the RCA, CAS, Lumen Art Projects and FLUX  Events, research collaborations with the Electronic Visualisation and the Arts  conference (EVA) in London and Leicester-based arts organisation Interact  Digital Arts. The exhibition and related events reflect upon the 50 years since  Event One surveying the impact and legacies of early computer art, and engaging  critical questions on the historical evolution of technology and creative  practices with computation.</p>

  <p>The FLUX  Events' selection features an array of creative practices including  computation, digital media and new technologies such as VR, AI, EEG  technologies, real-time data visualisation and live body-mapping. I am now a  member FLUX but when I began my  practice  in 1970, very few artists had access to computers and instead my interests were  in kinetic and light art. During the early 80s while researching new methods  for creating light sculpture, I invented a remarkable way to create lightforms  that appear translucent and weightless by combining skilful lighting of waves  on a rapidly moving string. <br />
    The phase structure  of the waveforms is revealed by changing the colour of illumination at high  speed, much faster than the eye can see. Instead the eye perceives multiple  colours highlighting different parts of the waveforms through the persistence  of vision which appears to turn a single fast moving string into a complex volumetric  display. </p>
The patterns are partly harmonic but unstable  and chaotic, challenging our comprehension and intriguing in their complexity.</div>

  <p>While early  versions of the special light sources, called chromastrobic lights could only  change in a limited range of patterns, with the advent of high power LEDs complex   colour changes became possible. By this point in the early  noughties, I had taught myself to code and working in collaboration with   electronic engineer, Louis Norwood, developed a fully  programmable chromastrobic light. The LEDs, although they are standard, require  special driver circuits to allow them to be modulated, changing their brightness  and apparent colour at up to 10,000 times per second. </p>

  <p>Undulation,  the light sculpture chosen for EVENT TWO was first  exhibited at The Isaac Newton Institute for Mathematical Sciences at  Cambridge University. The institute organised a series of workshops on Growth,  Form and Self-organisation in 2017 and invited 10 artists to participate. For  me it was a particularly curious experience as I had grown up in Cambridge  where my father was a mathematician in the Department of Mathematics and  Theoretical Physics. I realised how the subject has evolved over the years and  people are now working on problems that would once have been considered  impossible or perhaps frivolous. There is no mathematical theory that accounts  for the complex wave patterns I discovered on a spinning string, the problem  remains an unsolved wonder to contemplate.</p>
  <p>The work shown at EVENT TWO is slightly  different from the piece shown in Cambridge, adding an interactive touchscreen display  that allows visitors to select the colours on the waveforms using the Artist&rsquo;s  control software.</p>

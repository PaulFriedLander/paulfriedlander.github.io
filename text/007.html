        <font size="5">At last someone has opened an internet cafe that's not 
        just for geeks. The design of Nutopia, says Jonathan Glancey, is as innovative 
        as the technology it offers up on its sleek, streamlined terminals</font><br>
        <br>
        <br>
        Ever since Stanley Kubrick released his magisterial 2001: A Space Odyssey 
        people have dreamed of inhabiting the film's supercool interiors.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000000">That was in 1968, when Nasa's own living spaces 
        were about as glamorous as an electrician's workshop, but the movie sets 
        still look good. They have influenced generations of designers from Tom 
        Dixon and Mare Newson to Grant Mitchell, the New Zealander who has just 
        put his stamp on London's newest internet cafe, the ethereally good-looking 
        Nutopia. </font></p>
      <p><font color="#000000">Mitchell and his associates make the link explicit 
        - the new cafe is, they say, 'challenging the imagination of its competitors 
        with interiors that steal from Kubrick's masterpiece'. It also 'aims to 
        provide a space where technology meets creativity in an environment designed 
        to appeal to a style-conscious clientele". That claim, loosely translated, 
        means that a group of talented young computer and design buffs have created 
        the first convincing "cybercafe", a space that aims to match the dream 
        of computer technology.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000000">Mitchell, 35, came to England from Auckland 15 
        years ago. He studied the piano from the age of five, but trained as a 
        graphic designer before emigrating. He liked the idea, of setting up some 
        sort of work and meeting place where anyone could drop by, and was disappointed 
        by the internet cafes that sprang up across Britain in the 90s. There 
        was a mismatch, he thought, between what computers could do in terms of 
        imagery, and the look and feel of internet cafes' and offices that revolved 
        around computers.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000000">So Mitchell teamed up with George Philippakos (Nutopia's 
        IT director) and Toula Philippakou (its operations manager) to create 
        a corner of the capital in which those willing to pay £5 an hour can disappear 
        into a computer-generated virtual world while inhabiting a workplace that 
        is itself about as close to cyberspace as you can hope to find.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000000">The Nutopia concept will doubtless be copied, but 
        Mitchell and gang intend to keep several steps ahead of their rivals. 
        What they have between them is that all too rare mix of passion, energy, 
        imagination and technical know-how. 'It's about imagining what we could 
        do and could be" says Mitchell. 'The name Nutopia comes from a statement 
        made by John Lennon and Yoko Ono in 1973. We announce, they said, the 
        birth of a conceptual country, Nutopia. It has no, land, no boundaries 
        or passports, only people". And this, more or less, is what Mitchell and 
        co have set out to achieve in Covent Garden - a space where boundaries 
        dissolve and it can be hard to tell what is real and what is unreal.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000000">Karl Marx, after a few glasses of claret, might 
        have liked working in Nutopia, for here, like nowhere else in London, 
        all that's solid really does appear to melt into the air. By mixing old 
        and new technologies - film projectors, slides, computer-generated imagery 
        -Nutopia escapes the unthinking attachment to the new that distorts so 
        much current thinking.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000000">Low lighting levels, fish tanks, wires and cables 
        hushed away are just some of the elements that help to make Nutopia such 
        an airy and relaxing space to he in and work in. These, and the continually 
        changing installations of furniture, fittings and art- works chosen by 
        Mitchell and co. On display until the beginning of April are alight-emitting 
        polycarbonate sofa by Ansel Thompson; a kinetic light sculpture made of 
        three skipping ropes and a chromastrobic light by Paul Friedlander; and 
        wall-mounted light panels by Jason Bruges that change as you move across 
        or in font of them. These are inspired designs that connect the pop art 
        world of the 6os with that of the 2000s and the promise of cyberspace.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000000">The question that emerges and morphs in the brain 
        after a mind- expanding visit to--Nutopla is this: why, given the ablity 
        of computer programs to generate fantastic visions, are architects and 
        designers incapable of realising such digital dreams in real space?</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000000">It's true that without computer modelling we would 
        never have seen such brave and inventive buildings as Frank Gehry's Guggenheim 
        Museum in Bilbao or Renzo Piano's Kansai International Airport. And yet, 
        inside, neither building offers a breakaway sense of space. This is for 
        one necessary reason: they are required to perform tasks - the display 
        of artworks of many periods, the mass movement of people - that more fantastic 
        configurations might only confuse. Except in the smoke-and-mirror games 
        played in spaces like Nutopia, the cyberdream can so far only be seen 
        on computer screens and in books.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000000"> Hybrid Space, a new book by Peter Zellner, a US 
        architect who studied with Rem Koolhaas at Harvard, looks at the work 
        of a dozen architectural practices worldwide. All are attempting to connect 
        the real world with the virtual world, to exploit the computer's ability 
        to create unexpected new forms through digital animation and complex algorithms, 
        even to crossbreed biology and technology (very much a 60s dream; try 
        not to think of Roger Dean's album covers for Yes). 'Their researches 
        says Zellner, "are triggering a phase-shift in our perception and comprehension 
        of space, materiality and time at the start of the new millennium."</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000000">Maybe. This is, of course, millennial and thus 
        messianic thinking, although no less valuable for that. Many of the weird 
        and wonderful spaces shown in the book are as unattainable, given existing 
        building materials and technology, as the speed of light is for a spaceship, 
        even the wonderful machines that moved so gracefully through 2001. That 
        said, it is also true that Ludwig Mics van der Rohe, the 'great Prussian 
        modernist, designed two remarkable glass skyscrapers between 1919 and 
        1921. These were to set the tone of many of the best office buildings 
        of the 20th century, but at the time Mies conjured them, they were impossible 
        to realise.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000000">The mere fact that Zellner's architects are thinking 
        about cyberspace is important. Architecture need not come to a full stop 
        with bricks and mortar, steel and glass or even poly-carbonates and neoprene. 
        At the moment, however, we will have to make do with subtly theatrical 
        spaces like Nutopia. This gives us the feel of what we might yet achieve 
        as computer design comes of age and we begin to see how we might create 
        buildings and interiors as ethereal and happily uncertain as a magic lantern 
        show. Or Mitchell's favourite interior, the Louis-XV-meets- supertech 
        hotel room somewhere deep in hyperspace where Dr David Bowman, hero of 
        2001, arrives during the last reel of Kubrick's masterly exploration of 
        future space.</font></p>

        Hybrid Space is published by Thames & Hudson, price 24.95. </font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Crucial Breakthrough?</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 1998 Dirgit Dopfer published 
        her PhD thesis in which she described the discovery of a new form of entanglement. 
        It has long been known that photons in a double slit experiment will behave 
        differently depending on whether or not observations are made on which 
        slit they pass through. Dopfer's experiment showed that this change in 
        behaviour from wave like to particle like is communicated to the entangled 
        partner. This is a remarkable discovery. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Previously with polarisation 
        entanglement used in experiments on the violation of the Bell Inequality, 
        only the correlations between observations reveal the entangled connection. 
        With this new form of entanglement, it makes it possible to directly test 
        for super-luminal or instant communication between photons without the 
        need for observers, usually named Alice and Bob, to confer by conventional 
        means in order to confirm that information has been passed. More extraordinary 
        still, it implies that retro-causal communication should be possible, 
        to receive a message before it is sent.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Most people would assume that time 
  travel is impossible and science fiction is full of accounts of contradictory 
  plots to demonstrate the point. In Robert Heinlein's 'All You Zombies' with 
  the addition of a sex change the protagonist is both his own father and mother. 
  Curiously however a few physicists take a different view. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Here I consider a special type of 
  time travel: the transmission of information only. There is a theorem that states 
  that there has to be a certain minimum energy associated with a given amount 
  of information and so normally it would be necessary to transport this energy 
  associated with the information as well, but there appears to be a special case 
  where this does not apply. It involves entanglement and if correct this would 
  allow us to transport pure information backwards through time. The experiments 
  needed to test the idea are relatively easy to perform and there is a possibility 
  that there could be a breakthrough in the near future. Entangled particles form 
  the basis of many experiments, mostly as part of a design for a quantum computer. 
  These entangled states are still quite poorly understood and this idea grows 
  out of a specific experiment carried out to understand them better. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To appreciate how this is possible 
  I will explain a number of important ideas from physics, those familiar with 
  these standard facts please be patient. The first is wave particle duality. 
  Light (or indeed all matter if you observe close enough at a microscopic scale) 
  possesses properties of waves and particles. It cannot be both at once since 
  these are fundamentally different but it will show one or other of its characteristics 
  depending on the situation. Generally light behaves like a particle when it 
  is created and again when it is absorbed. While it is moving, it flies like 
  a wave. There is one important exception I will describe.</font></p>

      Fig. 1 Two sources of waves in a ripple tank overlap to create interference 
      patterns. Where the peaks and troughs oppose each other, the waves cancel 
      to produce calm zones. Where the peaks or troughs are in phase, they reinforce 
      to produce stronger waves. </font></td>
    <td width="55%"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Fig. 2 Light from 
      a laser passes through a double slit and produces an interference pattern 
      of light and dark bands. To achieve this each slit has to act as a separate 
      source of light. For sufficiently narrow slits, this is what happens; the 
      light is diffracted as it passes through the slits and does not form a sharp 
      shadow. Instead it spreads out like water waves and interferes with light 
      from the other slit.</font></td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Imagine first some ripples on a pond. 
  (Fig 1) If I start my ripples by disturbing the water at just one point near 
  one side, they would spread as out as semi circles. If I make more waves starting 
  from a place close by to the first source, the waves will spread out from this 
  second point and as the waves cross over each other they make a characteristic 
  pattern called interference. It is a misleading name as they interact in a very 
  orderly way. Visual artists familiar with op art may remember something called 
  the moir&eacute; pattern. If you overlay two parallels sets of lines, or concentric 
  arcs of circles in this case, the lines produce strong fringes where they overlay 
  each other. The waves do the same thing: where two peaks of a wave meet they 
  reinforce, where a peak meets a trough they cancel out. If you do an experiment 
  with light waves which are microscopically small and pass them through two narrow 
  slits, interference patterns form and are visible to the naked eye since they 
  can be much larger than the waves that produced them. It takes a little care 
  to set the experiment up so that the pattern is large enough to see but it is 
  fairly easy using a laser. If we put a screen behind the double slit for the 
  light to fall on, then we would see a series of fringes as shown in fig 2.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So far nothing remarkable has happened. 
  The strange bit comes next. According to one of the theorems of quantum mechanics, 
  Complementarity, we can never simultaneously observe the wave and particle like 
  behaviour of light or anything else at the same time. For example we might ask 
  if the light source is so faint that only one photon at a time is present in 
  the experiment, can a photon interfere with itself? The answer is yes it can. 
  Does that mean it splits into two separate halves to pass through the two slits? 
  Perhaps so, or rather two possible versions of the photon, neither of which 
  definitely exist move along two possible paths, one going through each slit. 
  Exactly how it does this is a great mystery: if you try and watch which slit 
  the photon passes through, it will pass through only one slit and it will no 
  longer interfere. If we keep watching, the photons randomly pass through either 
  slit but we would never see them divide. If we use a time-lapse photo to record 
  the pattern of light and all we would see are two bright zones with no interference 
  as shown in upper right graph of fig. 3. The photons seem to know when they 
  are watched. This 'self-consciousness' of the photon is a strange quantum mechanical 
  property and it will be a key feature of the time machine.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Einstein's View </b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Einstein was deeply troubled 
        by the problem of time. In the old way of understanding with universal 
        time and space, the present moment was unique and unambiguous. Only the 
        present really existed, the past was done and the future yet to come. 
        With the advent of Special Relativity this all changed, the present moment 
        was defined differently for each frame of reference. If I pace up and 
        down while I am thinking about this, I am changing my position and velocity 
        and hence my frame of reference. In a galaxy far far away, my estimate 
        of what day today is for the citizen of that far off place will be wobbling 
        around by more than a 100 years as I change the direction I walk in. The 
        bigger the distances involved and the bigger the velocity change the more 
        marked these effects become. It only makes sense if we acknowledge that 
        the whole of space-time all coexists, but then how are we to understand 
        the special quality of the moment we call now?</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Einstein passionately believed 
        in causality, the strict temporal ordering of events. The structure of 
        special relativity appears to enforce causality. The mathematical formalism 
        prevents matter and energy from accelerating to speeds faster than light, 
        a necessary corollary, since anything going faster than light can also 
        travel back in time. What he missed was that there might be a way to transmit 
        pure information, unconnected with mass or energy.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The situation with General 
        Relativity (GR) is far more complex because of the richness of the theorem. 
        Einstein was disturbed to find that it implied many things that he had 
        not anticipated. Shortly after publishing GR, the Russian physicist Freedman 
        showed that it implies that the universe is unstable, either expanding 
        or contracting, and therefore that time must either have a beginning or 
        an end. The Big Bang and the expanding universe were unknown at the time. 
        In the former way of thinking it was presumed that the universe and time 
        were eternal. This discovery was a terrible shock to Einstein who tried 
        to get this result suppressed. Afterwards he apologised to Freedman but 
        it was to be the beginning of a rocky road for Einstein whose wonderful 
        career never shown so bright again .</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And here is something else 
        to think about next time you are watching the stars: for starlight, time 
        does not exist at all. From the frame of reference of the light, it leaves 
        its distant star and arrives here all in the same instant.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">OK, so where does the entanglement 
  come in you are wondering? Imagine a mother is having identical twins, but we 
  do not know what sex they are beforehand. Once we know the sex of one, the other 
  will be the same. In the quantum world, we have to imagine that our 'unborn' 
  entangled photons are hermaphrodite. They have no sex initially, but the sex 
  does at some point become determined. It is not literally sex but some property 
  of the quanta. There are different kinds of entanglement and the strange quality 
  they share is that although there is no way of knowing in advance how this particular 
  property will show itself, the entangled quanta seem to have some secret way 
  of knowing each others behaviour so that it is always correlates. In this case 
  we will be looking at pairs of photons that will either behave like waves or 
  particles.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Wheeler's Delayed Choice 
        Paradox</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The physicist John Wheeler 
        thought about the double slit experiment and asked himself: what would 
        happen if we did not decide whether to check which way the photons went 
        until after they had passed the slit, would they still respond so as to 
        show only their particle or wave identity but never both at once? In a 
        lab light moves so quickly it is hard to delay the decision on how we 
        are to measure it, but supposing that we used a light source that was 
        a distant quasar, billions of light years away. The light could have been 
        travelling towards us for longer than the World exists and yet apparently 
        it still does not decide whether to behave like a wave or a particle until 
        it encounters some measuring apparatus. This experiment, although it is 
        probably impossible to carry out does not sound to physicists as impossible 
        as you might imagine. Some objects in the universe bend light, indeed 
        any large mass will. There are quasars known that lie directly behind 
        other galaxies so that their image is distorted and magnified by passing 
        a nearer galaxy on the way to our telescopes. We would have to find a 
        quasar where there were just two paths around the intervening lensing 
        object. The observer can adjust the relative path length to get the light 
        in phase by delaying the light arriving along the shorter path by passing 
        it through a suitable fibre optic. In practice this might be very difficult 
        since the two paths might differ in length by light years but no matter. 
        This is a thought experiment. It is hard to perform but pefectly logical. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Wheeler's delayed choice paradox 
        has been with us for many years. No one has refuted it. Has any one tested 
        it? The answer is yes; in 2001 there was an experiment that appears to 
        confirm that the light really does not 'decide' how it is going to travel 
        until it gets there. This was a laboratory set-up. It did not involve 
        starlight and the time period is only nanoseconds for the light to pass 
        through the apparatus. A short time but significant because the effect 
        precedes the cause.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I shall begin by describing an idealised 
  form of experiment; it is slightly different from any experiment that has actually 
  been carried out but easier to understand and could be performed. (John G Cramer 
  has announced plans to do so.) Imagine an experiment where entangled pairs of 
  photons set off down two different paths. Along each route, the light beams 
  will pass through a double slit and then after that they will go to some measuring 
  apparatus. There are two routes, each with their own identical double slit. 
  We have to set up the experiment precisely so that when a single photon passes 
  through one of the slits, its entangled partner will be passing through a slit 
  in the other path. Everything described so far will be exactly the same for 
  each of the two paths; the routes are only different when it comes to the measuring 
  apparatus. Along the upper route we provide a way to observe which of the double 
  slits the individual photons pass through. On the lower route, we simply gather 
  the light without checking which of the slits it passed through. The design 
  of the apparatus allows us to choose whether we see which way the light passed 
  through the slits with a lens. If it focuses the image of the slits, we see 
  which way the light came, if it is out of focus, we still measure the photons 
  arriving, but no longer know which slit they come through as the image is now 
  blurred. In focus we see the two slits, out of focus, the blurry but recognizable 
  interference pattern will show. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The prediction is that on the lower 
  path, the entangled sister photons respond to what is happening in the upper 
  path and behave in the same way. If the light in the upper path is being sharply 
  focussed, there will be no fringes visible in the lower path either. If the 
  light in the upper path is out of focus and fringes are present, then the fringes 
  show in the lower path too. The entangled photons have to have the same properties. 
  They will either both behave like particles or both behave like waves. This 
  experiment is not the same as the Delayed Choice Paradox but you can see that 
  it relates to it. Wheeler suspected that the photons anticipate how they will 
  be detected and travel accordingly, either moving like waves or particles. In 
  the new experiment, we can change how we view one path and we expect to find 
  that the entangled partner photons respond to this change.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But now here is the extra strange 
  part of the experiment. The upper arm is longer than the lower arm. The photons 
  have to go further from the source to reach the detector. The difference in 
  length is not great but it is very important because the photons in the short 
  lower path have already arrived at their detector before the photons in the 
  upper arm have reached their detector and yet they still anticipate how that 
  detection is going to be made and behave accordingly. The measurement in the 
  longer path is forcing photons in the shorter arm to change their behaviour 
  even though the upper arm photons are still en route to their detector at the 
  moment the lower arm photons complete their journey.</font></p>

        data from the lower arm, the 'receiver'. The two graphs on the left show 
        the interference pattern visible when the detector is out of focus position. 
        The graphs on the right show the double slit image in focus in the upper

        from the interference pattern. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The entangled photons from 
        the top arm mysteriously pass a message about how they are being observed

        of causality may breakdown.</font></p>

</table>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">An experiment similar but not identical 
  to the one I have described has already been carried out. That experiment confirms 
  definitely that the photons in the two paths are connected in the way they respond 
  to how they are observed; there is no doubt about this connection. A controversy 
  arises over the question of the timing and the assertion that the lower arm 
  anticipates the upper arm. The details of the actual experiment involve an additional 
  device called a coincidence detector. In the real experiment, there are a lot 
  of stray photons floating around, and in order to distinguish the true entangled 
  photon pairs from any other photons, the coincidence detector records when two 
  photons arrive at the detectors simultaneously, or almost simultaneously and 
  ignores all others. Since one light path is shorter, photons will arrive a few 
  nanoseconds (billionths of a second) earlier on the short path but this small 
  delay will still be recorded as a coincidence. This does not cause any confusion 
  since the number of photons is quite low and it might be a relatively long time; 
  say some 10 or 100s of microseconds before the next pair is recorded. Only coincident 
  photons are recorded, all others are ignored.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The real experiment was carried out 
  as part of Birgit Dopfer's Ph.D. in 1998. Her tutor, Anton Zeilinger, is one 
  of the world leaders in experimental optics and is well aware that something 
  interesting has been discovered but specifically denies that the time difference 
  is significant. Has he made a mistake or is there some legitimate reason for 
  ignoring it? Sometimes the Uncertainty Principle allows this sort of thing to 
  happen. Could this be the case here? If the answer were yes we would anticipate 
  that increasing the difference in the arm length would destroy the correlation. 
  The full technical details of the experiment are described in German but as 
  far as I can determine, the answer is no. This is a very important point and 
  something that was taken up by Ray Jensen who described the experiment to John 
  G Cramer. Ray Jensen was also the first to realise that using this result, it 
  is possible to design a time machine for information.</font></p>

  possible to carry out this 'two-armed' entangled light experiment with one very 
  long arm. I am on Pluto and I am receiving a steady stream of entangled photons 
  from a lab back on earth. Lets also assume that there are a lot of photons flowing

  practical because I would have to have a telescope so good that I could detect

  this is a thought experiment. I can now use this set up to send my report using

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 
        1986 John G Cramer published a new interpretation of quantum mechanics 
        (QM), the Transactional Interpretation (TI). It is particulary relevant 
        for understanding how light propagates. Imagine, he says, that light travels 
        not just in the one one direction we are used to from the source and forward 
        in time but that there is additional 'acceptor' wave travelling backwards 
        through time from the where the light is absorbed. It is by the transaction 
        of both waves moving between source and where it is absorbed that the 
        energy of the photon is transferred. This is a form of time travel that 
        is hidden from the observer under all normal conditions but none the less 
        is happening all the time. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This idea grew out of an earlier 
        unfinished idea first proposed by RIchard Feynman. An interpretation of 
        QM is intended to give a concept of what is happening to the quanta, something 
        that QM itself does not do but interpretations do not make new predictions. 
        Most physicists have not been persuaded to take this idea seriously. The 
        majority still follow the Copenhagen Interpretation (CI). Since 1983 Cramer 
        has re-analysed another quantum mystery, the Ashfar Experiment, and claims 
        that TI offers a betters explanation than either CI or The Many Worlds 
        (see below).</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If this new experiment to prove 
        retro-causality succeeds; it does not necessarily follow that physicists 
        would accept it as evidence in favour of TI. There are other ways to understand 
        the result. The controversy about what time travel means is likely to 
        continue even after it is proven.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">John G Cramer's ambitions are a little 
  less wild sounding but equally provocative. He intends to extend the length 
  of the upper arm by 10 kilometres using a pair of fibre optic cables. They can 
  be kept spooled up so all the equipment will sit happily in one lab. The fibre 
  optics will arranged with one fibre behind each of the double slits. The photons 
  will either travel down one or either fibre, if they are being watched, or they 
  will mysteriously divide and travel along both at once. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">With 10 kilometres of fibre optic, 
  the inverted delay is 50 microseconds. It does not sound like much but it will 
  be an extraordinary achievement if the experiment works. Until now the time 
  shifts involved have been very small and so far ignored. This still seems like 
  a very short time but it is 10,000 times longer than observed before. It will 
  prove that the effect is not limited to ultra short times only. It will open 
  the gateway to building a time machine for information. </font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Isaac Asimov's Concept</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The concept of a cascade of 
        small backward intervals of time was first explored by Isaac Asimov in 
        &quot;The Endochronic Properties of Resublimated Thiotimoline,&quot; published 
        in the March 1948 issue of Astounding Science Fiction and reprinted in 
        The Analog Anthology #1 (Davis, 1980). This was a spoof scientific article. 
        The article presents the description of fictitious substance thiotimoline. 
        Thiotimoline has the property that it dissolves 1.12 seconds before the 
        introduction of a solvent. Asimov further discusses telechronic batteries. 
        These use a series of cells containing thiotimoline connected to each 
        other through a process of adding water to extend the inverted delay time 
        over which the thiotimoline will dissolve. I quote: </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">'The principle behind the telechronic 
        battery is easy to understand and home experimenters will have no trouble 
        constructing their own. A test tube containing properly purified thiotimoline 
        is placed between a low-powered laser and a photoelectric cell. When the 
        thiotimoline dissolves, 1.12 seconds before the addition of water, the 
        formerly opaque thiotimoline becomes transparent and the photoelectric 
        cell is tripped. This in turn results in water being added to another 
        test tube containing thiotimoline. The thiotimoline in the second test 
        tube will, of course, dissolve 2.24 seconds before water was added to 
        the first tube. By cascading these &quot;endochronometers&quot; it is 
        possible to create a telechronic battery of any desired time constant. 
        Cascading 3215 endochronometers, for example, results in a battery in 
        which the last tube's thiotimoline dissolves about 1 hour before water 
        is added to the first tube.' </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+3">The First Time Gate</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The fictitious telechronic batteries 
  were limited in their ability to send an effect back through time by the number 
  of cells. The information they could send was only a single bit, either they 
  have or have not been exposed to solvent at a later point in time. In the real 
  world things will not be so limited. Even a 50 microsecond inverted delay, with 
  appropriate instrumentation becomes a very powerful discovery:</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Given that it should be possible 
  to receive a packet of information before it is sent, we can choose to re-send 
  that same package back through time again and again. By re-sending the information 
  many times it can be sent back indefinitely. The information can never be sent 
  back to an earlier time than when the experiment first becomes fully operational 
  but having once opened the 'Time Gate', there is no limit in principle to how 
  far in the future information may come back to us from.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This single experiment alone leads 
  to an entirely new world but it will take a lot to convince most physicists 
  and probably at least one other group of researchers will have to repeat the 
  experiment before it will be widely believed. The current culture in physics 
  is surprisingly conservative, there are only a very few researchers who would 
  risk their time and reputation on this venture. The consensus is that we already 
  know all the important ideas at the low energy levels associated with this kind 
  of experiment. The first shake up would come for physicists having to admit 
  that time had changed. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The really important consequences 
  for society as a whole are far greater and almost impossible to anticipate. 
  Some may view this as a threat, others as a new age. Whatever each individuals 
  view, society as a whole will respond and this may prove another key factor 
  in developments. It is my judgment that the technical difficulties in transforming 
  an initial experiment into a mature time technology will be relatively trivial. 
  If sufficient effort is brought to bear we can anticipate this would happen 
  within a matter of years. If for example the proof of principle were reached 
  this year, 2007, then by about 2012, the consequences would begin to be felt. 
  What do I have in mind? Well here is just one possibility:</font></p>
<table width="80%" border="2">

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Secret Time Gate</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Let us imagine a small group 
        of physicists decide to develop the Time Gate purely for their self-interest. 
        We are all familiar with the short term volatility of the stock market 
        so as soon as the experiment is working well enough that it can send back 
        in time a reasonably large list of stock prices of over no more than a 
        few minutes, the project can begin in earnest. Using seed money from their 
        own small savings they put themselves into a position of unstoppable advantage. 
        We can assume these are very smart guys and they soon figure out how to 
        automate the whole process so that a computer compares current prices 
        with upcoming prices and then makes all the appropriate trades constantly 
        changing their portfolio in anticipation of each change. They can be assured 
        of frequent gains, almost no losses and gains coming almost every few 
        minutes. Whilst their portfolio remains small, their presence will go 
        unnoticed but it is the nature of exponential growth that it cannot remain 
        like that for long. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Since they are a very smart 
        bunch of guys they can predict ahead using other means than the Time Gate 
        to give themselves some approximate idea of what will happen further off 
        in the future. By an adaptation of perturbation theory to this special 
        case, they will be able to anticipate when their presence would be felt. 
        This would happen when they become very major traders. Before the market 
        became aware that some major new force is eating up shares unstoppably, 
        their ability to anticipate a possible chaotic change or collapse in share 
        prices will allow them to shift strategy. By this point they might well 
        be the world's largest stockholders. This should give them more than ample 
        choice of where they want to go next.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Whilst only a single group of researchers 
  secretly use their knowledge of the future for personal gain, their position 
  appears strong but in reality is fragile and short lived. The kind of information

  The moment this changes, all hell breaks loose. The markets would close; the 
  world would panic. </font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">An idea introduced by Hugh 
        Everett as an alternative to the mysterious collapse of the wave function 
        in quantum mechanics. He showed that when the equations show that several 
        different events are possible, it could be argued that all the possibilities 
        happen, each in their own separate universe. This appears to lead to an 
        exponential number of new universes continuously being created, including 
        multiple copies of myself all writing slightly different versions of this 
        article. Max Tegmark dismisses the criticism that an exponential number 
        of new universes are being created. He argues that the number is finite 
        and that the parallel worlds are mostly very similar and frequently merge 
        as well. He considers the size not a problem at all. Viewed from a timeless 
        point of view, as Barbour would, all possible configurations of the universe 
        exist eternally so there is no growth at all. David Deutch, who was responsible 
        for much of the early theoretical research in quantum computing, also 
        believes in the theory.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Many Worlds, if real, could 
        have a major impact on time travel, as we would find ourselves in contact 
        with many different versions of the future. I suggest that it would act 
        as a filter blocking certain types of information. Any variations that 
        are random, perhaps for example the future state of the stock market as 
        described above. We would receive messages from numerous different versions 
        of the future in which the stock prices did not agree. As a result our 
        instruments would not produce clear readings when we tried to access this 
        purely stochastic information. On the other hand a process that is presently 
        beyond human understanding but for which there is almost certainly is 
        a perfectly good deterministic theory, say being able to predict an earthquake, 
        the warning should come through very clearly as in any version of the 
        World that is substantially similar to this one, earthquakes will still 
        happen at the same moments.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The end of the age of capitalism 
  might just be one small step compared with what lies ahead. It would however 
  to be a mistake to assume that this is an unavoidable conclusion. Not all information 
  about the future would necessarily become available to us; something's may remain 
  unknown. (See Many Worlds) Exactly how this we will work is not yet understood. 
  The concepts of present and future would partly merge. There would be distinctions 
  but not as we know them today. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As soon as the time gate technology 
  comes becomes widely known, the rush will be on to retrieve information from 
  the future. Very quickly this will mushroom into a vast industry, the World 
  will be gripped by great excitement. It is hard, indeed impossible, for us to 
  imagine accurately now what this will feel like. It will be an extraordinary 
  period. The idea that the future is coming within view will be an intoxicant 
  for science, industry, commerce and the military. This will be seen as the biggest 
  idea ever.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">With thousands or in fact millions 
  of Time Gates opening up, we observe another key feature of retro-causality. 
  So long as advanced technical civilization exists, it will build Time Gates. 
  If the continuity of civilization is maintained unbroken information will continue 
  to be handed back over arbitrarily long intervals of time. We can infer that 
  rather a short time after the opening of the first Time Gates, an avalanche 
  effect will insure that we will start to receive information from further and 
  further into the future. The upper limit to the retro transmission of information 
  is set only by the longevity of that future technical society.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It is my prediction that in the event 
  the Cramer/Jensen experiment succeeds (or anyone else), there will be a pause 
  while others verify this work. There will be a further period while we search 
  really hard to find if there are any hidden factors preventing the unrestricted 
  use of the retro-causal data. If no such restrictions are found, very shortly 
  afterwards a great wave of excitement will engulf physicists. The excitement 
  will spread rapidly out from the physics community and the race will be on to 
  realise this dream. With a prize this great, the intensity of activity would 
  be unprecedented. Like the Moon Race, it would be a great engineering feat, 
  unlike the Moon Race, it would not necessarily be centrally organised. There 
  would be many different groups and organisations all scrambling to get in on 
  the action. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I cannot imagine anything more utterly 
  and totally extraordinary: the idea that I might live to, indeed within a short 
  number of years, be in a position to learn about the science, technology and 
  history of our near and distant future. This seems to belong to a realm of pure 
  fantasy but no so. At the very least we have brought this within the reach of 
  hard SF. And there is the remote, but not non-zero probability that this is 
  about to happen. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Let us now consider another kind 
  of information arriving from the future: science and technology. Unlike the 
  stock prices this will remain accurate even after the information is freely 
  and openly available. We can imagine that in this situation, many workers will 
  seek to reproduce methods and results already known about in the future. This 
  introduces us to the yet another variant on the familiar paradoxes of time travel. 
  Is this the showstopper or can we still push ahead with this line of reasoning? 
  Who, it will be asked, originated an idea if the first to work on it learnt 
  about the concept in papers not yet published. Will they find their own names 
  on those papers or other? It looks like cheating. It must be admitted that there 
  are far more unanswered questions at this point than clear answers. The fact 
  that even a few physicist are prepared to countenance such ideas should be persuade 
  us to at least take seriously an idea that it would be only to easy to dismiss.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Richard Feynman on Time</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Undoubtedly one of the most 
        influential physicists of the 20th century, arguably standing second in 
        line after Einstein, Feynman introduced the idea that we treat antimatter 
        as matter travelling backwards in time. It is one of the key ideas that 
        he used in developing the Feynman Diagrams that provide the basic tool 
        with which almost all particle physicists have worked with ever since. 
        His own view on quantum mechanics was that we should treat particles and 
        photons as capable of doing anything, indeed that they did everything 
        and they travelled on all possible paths open to them, multiple copies 
        of each fundamental particle simultaneously buzzing out in all kinds or 
        crazy ways. Light travelling in curved or twisted routes, even moving 
        backwards in time. You then sum all these possible histories together, 
        the math shows that most of them cancel out and out pops the consistent 
        paths. This is not just a crazy idea; he showed this is a good way of 
        predicting how experiments will behave. It solves for example the double 
        slit problem of how one photon can go through two slits.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">By a logical extension of Feynman's 
        consistent paths, the same rules can be applied to calculating what can 
        or cannot be done in time travel. Nick Herbert writes: 'Killing your grandmother 
        before your mother was born would create an inconsistent history so is 
        forbidden. What you would experience if you tried to kill your grandmother 
        would be strange quantum forces that magically prevent this action from 
        happening no matter how hard you tried. These quantum forces would be 
        similar to the Pauli Exclusion Principle for the electrons that hold matter 
        together. The Temporal Consistency Principle is a kind of Pauli Principle 
        acting through time rather than space.'</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+3">Conclusion</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I have described how an experiment 
  to detect retro-causality maybe carried out in the near future. By Application 
  of the 'Asimov Daisy Chain' any small inverted time delay can be amplified by 
  a factor in excess of a million, extending from microseconds to minutes the 
  shift in time. By industrial scale development of vast numbers of 'Time Gates', 
  subject to sharing this information, the second level of amplification triggers 
  an avalanche of information arriving from all our future histories where Time 
  Gates are in use. What might start as a 50 microsecond inverted delay can grow 
  to a giant.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We live in the post modernist era. 
  Intellectuals argue over the definition of this term or whether it really has 
  meaning at all but no one can deny that the quality of social change has altered 
  and that arguably this is a new era. It may however be but a brief interlude. 
  The age that we called modernism was characterised by the dominance of engineering 
  and the physical sciences literally re-moulding society. The landscape was first 
  changed by mechanised transport. Later the arrival of telecommunications and 
  computers provided enhanced access to information. Physics played a key role 
  in driving the engine of change. Along with the technical change came tolerance, 
  progressive politics and imaginative art and design. Today innovation continues 
  but physics plays little part in it. The last time that physics shook the world 
  is now more than 60 years in the past. It appears that following the devastating 
  vision of nuclear war; physicists took a vow to detach themselves from everyday 
  life. This is far from true, some passionately argued the importance of a social 
  conscience and the need to evaluate the impact of research but for most the 
  question was simply not relevant. They had moved onto areas that had no conceivable 
  application either in the near or longer term future. They became involved with 
  pure ideas, first successfully exploring the properties of high-energy particles 
  and subsequently in pursuit of a unification of all physical forces. Initially 
  governments were happy to grant to physicists almost unlimited freedom to choose 
  their research but as the decades passed and no new ideas emerged that lead 
  to practical applications, the climate that physicists found themselves working 
  in has changed. Today there is a lively focus of research around quantum computing 
  and cryptography. This is perhaps the only area where it looks hopeful that 
  some important practical applications of great consequence maybe found. Outside 
  this specialist area, the prospects for physics are not so good with the long 
  sort after breakthrough in String Theory not expected anytime soon. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Most physicists and serious intellectuals 
  would argue that ideas concerning time travel are wild conjecture and prefer 
  not to consider the subject. I suggest that there is good reason to reflect 
  upon this since even if the chances of a breakthrough are slim, the consequences 
  are so significant. Amongst cosmologists, Paul Davies and John D Barrow have 
  both recently put in writing that a breakthrough in time travel is possible 
  in the not too distant future. There others in this field who hold the same 
  views and some who have even gone to the length of designing time machines, 
  all be it, only as thought experiments. Most famous for this is Kip Thorne whose 
  proposal for using a worm whole held open with exotic matter stirred up a huge 
  debate. Thorne's ideas are based on general relativity; a subject where others 
  had already proved a number of time machine like solutions to the equations 
  existed. Einstein with his strict adherence to the principle of causality would 
  have been unhappy about it, but the mixture of special and general relativity 
  combined with quantum mechanics creates a mixture of paradoxes that more than 
  likely can only be resolved by accepting the reality of some sort of time travel.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If this change comes it will be the 
  single largest influence on society that science has ever brought. To my knowledge 
  no writer, either serious or fictional, has succeeded in reflecting upon the 
  true impact that knowledge of the future will bring. The subject is simply so 
  huge as to overwhelm. It has the potential to transform our civilization and 
  take us into an era as different as today is from the Stone Age.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I will introduce a formalism to concisely 
  represent my conjecture concerning the social impact of time technology. Following 
  the form introduced by Barbour who refers to the singularity within Platonia 
  that corresponds to the Big Bang as 'The Alpha Point' and the speculative cosmology 
  of Barrow and Tippler, wherein the point at which consciousness gains control 
  over all matter and energy in all logically possible universes as 'Omega'. I 
  now posit a third point that I shall call 'The Mu Point'. </font></p>

  gains objective knowledge of its future. </u></b></font></p>

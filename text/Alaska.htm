      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Back in the heady 
        days of the sixties and seventies, physicists made such rapid progress 
        they thought they would soon find a Theory of Everything. By the early 
        eighties, this search had produced String Theory, and around the same 
        time by coincidence, I discovered something else wonderful about string.

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Today, String Theory 
        has evolved into many branches and is still in search of its holy grail, 
        a Theory of Everything. It has received harsh criticism for failing to 
        deliver, but remains the dominant ways of thinking in theoretical physics. 
        For physicists, the challenge is to unravel the almost infinite number 
        of ways higher dimensional strings can behave.<br>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The string in this 
        exhibit is different from fundamental or Superstring. It shows complex 
        behavior - both chaotic and harmonic - within our familiar three spatial 
        dimensions. This is something physicists had not anticipated, as their 
        idealized Superstrings are assumed to vibrate harmonically, like the strings 
        of a musical instrument. I am intrigued by what would happen if such complex 
        behavior were included in String Theory.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF"><font face="Aero, Verdana, Arial" size="+2">Statement 
  of a Scientific Artist</font></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF">Scientists 
  and artists are I believe more similar than people realise. They are both passionate 
  about their work and prepared to work extraordinarily hard in pursuit of an 
  idea. These ideas do not exist in a vacuum; they exist in relation to an existing 
  body of work. Some individuals will add to that body of work but for those that 
  are most daring their own work will challenge and may seek to overthrow our 
  most basic ideas. </font> </p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF">My own first 
  inclination was to become a cosmologist. At that time I was a precocious teenager 
  and cosmology was undergoing a transformation, as a great debate within the 
  subject was to see the Big Bang theory rise to ascendancy and become the new 
  orthodoxy. The evidence gathered in favour of the Big Bang was strong and its 
  contender Steady State had clearly lost. I was horrified, as it looked to me 
  like the most illogical of ideas had won. I knew that if I was to be a cosmologist 
  I would I have to do battle with the new champion. I wanted to be daring but 
  in the circumstances I moved away from the subject for it would have been a 
  most formidable challenge. I changed direction and became an artist but I never 
  lost interest in cosmology and continue to watch with keen interest from the 
  sidelines. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF">More than 
  a generation later the Big Bang still rules the roost but it has never fully 
  resolved those logical problems. It is based on ideas that appear impossible 
  to ever substantiate by experiment. Worse still there is no agreed physical 
  theory that can explain the extraordinary conditions that must have existed 
  in the first instance of existence. The Big Bang has contributed to a crisis 
  in physics forcing physicists to search harder and harder to find a theory that 
  can describe that mysterious moment of creation and the presumed brief period 
  afterwards known as The Planck Epoch. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF">Most mysterious 
  of all the Big Bang requires us to believe that time has a beginning. The argument 
  in favour of time beginning arises in relativity where time is treated as a 
  geometrical property like distance and all space-time can be curved into a sculptural 
  form with finite limits. The effects of quantum mechanics however make the equations 
  of relativity breakdown under these extreme conditions.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF">In the installation 
  <i>Timeless Universe</i> shown at the Sala Parpallo, Valencia, Spain, I explore 
  an alternative cosmology: perhaps time does not exist. This idea proposed by 
  the English physicist Julian Barbour reaches beyond scientific cosmology, it 
  has philosophical, experiential and psychological implications. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF">My thanks 
  to my curator, Angela Molina for encouraging me to reveal more of my scientific 
  side, Julian Barbour for taking part in the conference, Stephen Hopkins for 
  reading my essay and providing many helpful criticisms and most of all to my 
  life partner, Voravanna Tonkul, for tolerating my need to work hard in pursuit 
  of an idea even while we were raising our now one year old daughter Natham. 
  The full length version of this essay along with essays by Angela Molina and 
  Julian Barbour will appear in the catalogue of the Timeless Universe exhibition 
  due to be published in 2007.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The French style magazine, 
  ACTUEL were the first to run a large piece on my work. Following my appearance 
  on the BBC2 arts program, the Late Show, they published a special issue of the 
  magazine devoted to Chaos, the scientific theory and its influence on contemporary 
  culture. The main article focused on English artists, they showed a full page 
  portrait along with another picture of my group, Earth Signals. Here the article 
  is reproduced in translation. </font></p>

<p>DELIRIOUS CHAOS: THE POETIC EXPLOSION By Ariel Kyrou</p>
<p> Wednesday, 23rd May 1990, 11 p.m.: the Late Show begins on BBC 2, before about 
  a million viewers. On the set, a painter, Piers Wardle, is attacking a canvas. 
  He makes rounded forms, draws bizarre shapes, indented, tangled, twisted, frag-mented, 
  sprung from some old surrealist dream. The presenter lets Ian Stewart take the 
  floor. Stewart, a brilliant young mathematician, has just published a book on 
  the theory of Chaos: Does God play dice ? (Penguin). Next, Benoit Mandelbrot 
  is introduced, the father of this gigantic scientific revolution called Chaos. 
  Greying hair, large spectacles, dressed in suit and tie, Mandelbrot does not 
  speak like a scientist, but like a poet; he speaks of ocean waves, of erra-tic 
  puffs of wind, of cloudscapes. but also of Jackson Pollock and the com-poser 
  Gyorgy Ligeti!</p>
<p> I do not understand anymore what is happening: after Mandelbrot, a giant of 
  contemporary science, here is Cohn, the lead singer of the Shamen. a house music 
  group, then Jim McClellan, a journalist from I-D, a magazine better known for 
  its love of fashion than for scientific rigour, and then a certain Paul Friedlander, 
  who presents his "kinetic sculptures" and his "Chaos Happening", or again Alan 
  Moore, a great strip cartoon script-writer. </p>
<p>They are all speaking about science. It is a bit as if the Rita Mitsoukis or 
  Margerin were talking about the Theory of Relativity and Quantum Mechanics on 
  Frederic Mitterand's set. </p>
<p>Let us follow one of the protagonists, Paul Friedlander the sculptor, to his 
  workplace, which is more of a comfortable London house than a studio. </p>
<p>Sitting cross-legged among his "kinetic sculptures", under the red, pink, blue 
  or yellow projectors, there is a curious mixture of a dozen people. They are 
  preparing Earth Signals an exhibition and a performance about Chaos. </p>
<p><img src="../images/Actuel2.jpg" width="75%"  align="right">Who are they ? 
  Cosmo, a solid bearded sprite in his fifties, video maker, has invented a laser 
  harp which, to his surprise, he found one day in the hands of Jean-Michel Jarre. 
  Dave, the maddest of them all, a young IT expert, is a musician equally enthusiastic 
  about Bach and electronics. Jessica, a little slip of a girl, who blushes at 
  the least question, is a dancer. Paul, still at University will set up, for 
  the exhibition, an installation of six computers, networked with other computers 
  in Europe: for a week they will exchange trans-formed images of "fractals", 
  those magnificent mathematical figures of Chaos. Kobus, a twenty-nine year old 
  physicist, will play with his group, the Fractal Fishes. Maggie, just out of 
  film school, has produced a film on "the unity of nature and science, starting 
  with images of infinity". And the others: Jane, designer; Niranjan, painter; 
  Nick, the ex-music teacher, inventor of wooden instruments with which he plays. 
</p>
<p>Whether they are uttering a few cryptic phrases, or launching into fiery tirades, 
  all are speaking of the science of Chaos as of something evident, a concept 
  that is still a little vague, but totally incorporated into their art, their 
  inventions, their way of life. Chaos ? Disorder ? But why is it fascinating 
  this group of young creative English minds so much ? </p>
<p>It is Paul Friedlander, the maestro of the "Chaos Happening", who has brought 
  them together here. Ten years ago, Friedlander was an unrecognised artist, a 
  visionary lost in a world of yuppies and art buyers. At the beginning of the 
  seventies, having obtained his degree in Physics, weary of the scientific spi-rit, 
  he had moved into light shows and kinetic art. His psychedelic wheels, his polystyrene 
  fountains and his chaotic strings rarely left his studio. Now, hardly a day 
  passes before a new amateur of Chaos calls him up, wishing to par-ticipate in 
  his Chaos performance. </p>
<p>Chaos is fashionable. But what is Chaos ? </p>
<p>Take one of Friedlander's "kinetic sculptures". It operates very simply: A 
  string, suspended between two stalks, which can be displaced in any direction. 
  At the end of this curious skipping rope, on the stalks two motors of different 
  power, and to supply the art, colour filters. You start the system up and the 
  string races away, dividing itself into two, three, four five madly unstable 
  rounds, separated by Islands of stillness: the bifurcation points. Don't touch 
  anything now: the chaotic system seems to converge to a curve, unpre-dictable 
  and irregular, which rules the disorder. This fragile curve is the strange attractor 
  of the system. One of the greatest inventions of the science of Chaos, the strange 
  attractor. </p>
<p>Chaos: that's not a mess, or total confusion. To begin with, it can arise in 
  a device as simple as Friedlander's sculpture: a string and two forces. Or in 
  an oscillating pendulum. Put a magnet near this; you introduce just one new 
  force, and Chaos is born; like the string of the sculpture, the pendulum moves 
  in all directions. Do you understand ? It is enough to have three different 
  forces, and Chaos arises in Nature. Only three! Imagine what can happen up above, 
  in the eddies of the clouds, or in a Parisian traffic jam. But wait: the science 
  of Chaos does not only tell us this; it also shows that unforeseen order can 
  emerge in the heat of disorder. </p>
<p>That is the reason why one can spend hours, fascinated, in front of this coloured, 
  changing string, why one can stay for hours watching the sea gnawed by the waves, 
  or the desert swept by the wind. Nature offers us countless strange attractors 
  which control disorder. Take the climate of our temperate zone: what restlessness. 
  It can hail in May, and the sun can shine brightly in February. And yet it will 
  never be Siberian or tropical, it keeps within the limits of an <u>attractor</u>. 
</p>
<p>Now touch one of the stalks of Friedlander's sculpture lightly: the string 
  will lose its shape, coil up and uncoil, into a different chaotic dance, with 
  a changed strange attractor. A touch has been sufficient to make the string 
  impose a different harmony on its disorder. The scientists say that the system 
  is "sensitive to initial conditions". Your finger has been the grain of sand 
  that derails the enfine, the orange zest that transforms an ordinary mousse 
  au cho-colat into a marvel for the palate. </p>
<p>A minute cause, a grain of dust, has caused an enormous upset. The meteorolo-gists 
  have a pretty image for this: the butterfly effect. A slight air displace-ment, 
  a butterfly fluttering above the great wall of China can cause a terrible hurricane 
  over Paris many months later. There have been chain reactions, con-nections, 
  chaotic bifurcations. Indeed, it was a meteorologist, Lorenz, who, analysing 
  climatic data on his old computer in 1964, discovered the butterfly effect, 
  and the first strange attractor in the history of science.</p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Key to this idea is pushing 
  materials beyond limits they have ever been used before. This would be the largest 
  carbon fibre structure ever constructed. Until now carbon fibre has chiefly 
  been used in special components, for example the blades of giant windmills and 
  parts of aeroplanes. Increasingly airplane manufacturers have come to consider 
  that the next generation of planes will be entirely carbon fibre. Will this 
  change happen in architecture too? The answer in most cases is no, the extra 
  cost would not justify it. One exception I propose will be the construction 
  of giant towers where the astonishing strength to weight ratio of carbon fibre 
  as compared with steel will actually make it cheaper to work in carbon even 
  though kilo for kilo it is still far more expensive. How is this possible?</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I came to realise that this 
  would be the case by comparison with the engineering of a space rocket. For 
  every kilo of payload you take to orbit, you need something of the order of 
  thirty kilos of fuel and oxidant. Although some of that is burnt early on, a 
  significant fraction has to be carried with you most of the way into orbit. 
  If you can increase the efficiency of the rocket, you reduce the amount of fuel 
  and oxidiser you need to carry and this can have a dramatic impact on the amount 
  of payload. A small improvement in rocket design can greatly increase the payload. 
  </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When we compare the situation 
  with constructing a tower, a similar logic applies. Imagine a structure say 
  initially 10 metres high built of steel. If we want to add another ten metres 
  on top, the first ten metres must be strong enough to take the extra weight 
  of the next ten. Go onto consider a further ten metres bringing the height to 
  thirty metres and the lower sections have to be stronger still. The higher you 
  go, the stronger the lower sections have to be to support the weight above. 
  The total weight increases exponentially with height, but if you can choose 
  a lighter material with comparable strength, the total weight can be far less. 
  The strength to weight ratio of carbon fibre is about five times better than 
  steel, but because of this accumulative advantage, the total difference in weight 
  between a tower built of carbon and steel will be far greater. I have estimated 
  that if the Flame was built of steel to a height of 150 metres, it would need 
  more than a thousand tons of steel. With carbon the weight might be only forty 
  tons or less. The exact weight is hard to estimate as it is likely that wind 
  forces will predominate and a final decision would revolve around judging how 
  strong a storm the Flame would need to withstand.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I plan the Flame shall be 
  an open structure constructed of an interlacing framework of carbon fibre tubes. 
  This will keep to the absolute minimum its wind resistance. The structure is 
  not intended to be strong enough to support the weight of people (except service 
  personnel who would only ascend in fine weather.) The only 'payload' it would 
  have to support would be the lighting system. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The lighting will be LEDs. 
  These are rapidly becoming not the lights of the future but the new lights of 
  today. We have seen astonishing technical progress in their brightness and efficiency 
  in the last two years and in the coming years this will be followed by their 
  widespread adoption and drop in price. The Flame can be lit by literally millions 
  of LEDs and this can be provided at a very reasonable cost and would not consume 
  very much energy as LEDs are rapidly becoming the most efficient light source 
  in existence. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For the control of the lighting 
  I imagine the individual LEDs working like pixels on a screen. The technology 
  for this already exists and is being used on a smaller scale on existing LED 
  installation but because it is based upon protocols already developed that are 
  compatible with very high resolution screens, the control systems can readily 
  be upgraded to achieve control over the Flame's vast array.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The lights shall be omni-directional. 
  They would be seen brilliantly from a distance in all directions. Close up they 
  would shine even brighter. The lights would be bright enough to be seen by day, 
  but they would really come into their own by night, when they would literally 
  burn as brightly as a real flame. The Flame would be visible from very many 
  kilometres away. Flying to Madrid by night, the Flame could be seen from over 
  a hundred kilometres away.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I imagine the Flame built 
  on columns. The columns would be laid out in a circular plan; each column about 
  ten metes high. The interlacing framework of carbon tubes would be mounted on 
  the columns. There would be a concourse under the Flame which the public will 
  be free to walk into with the Flame over their heads. This circular space will 
  be about forty metres in diameter: an area large enough to use as an open air 
  concert hall with room to seat a symphony orchestra and fair sized audience. 
  The orchestra would be for special occasions; in general I would like to see 
  the space open and free for people to walk in. </font></p>

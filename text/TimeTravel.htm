      <p><b><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Crucial Breakthrough?</font></b></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 1998 Dirgit Dopfer 
        published her PhD thesis in which she described the discovery of a new 
        form of entanglement. It has long been known that photons in a double 
        slit experiment will behave differently depending on whether or not observations 
        are made on which slit they pass through. Dopfer's experiment showed that 
        this change in behaviour from wave like to particle like is communicated 
        to the entangled partner. A remarkable discovery as this form of entanglement 
        is more controllable than the familiar polarisation entanglement used 
        in experiments on the violation of the Bell Inequality. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It offers a way to 
        test for true instant communication between photons without the need for 
        observers, usually named Alice and Bob to confer by conventional means 
        in order to confirm that information has been passed. More extraordinary 
        still, it implies that retro-causal communication should be possible, 
        the ability to receive a message before it is sent.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000">Most people 
  would assume that time travel is impossible and science fiction is full of accounts 
  of contradictory plots to demonstrate the point. In Robert Heinlein's 'All You 
  Zombies' with the addition of a sex change the protagonist is both his own father 
  and mother. Curiously however a few physicists take a different view. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000">Here I consider 
  a special type of time travel: the transmission of information only. There is 
  a theorem that states that there has to be a certain minimum energy associated 
  with a given amount of information and so normally it would be necessary to 
  transport this energy associated with the information as well, but there appears 
  to be a special case where this does not apply. It involves entanglement and 
  if correct this would allow us to transport pure information backwards through 
  time. The experiments needed to test the idea are relatively easy to perform 
  and there is a possiblity that there could be a breakthrough in the near future. 
  Entangled particles form the basis of many experiments, mostly as part of a 
  design for a quantum computer. These entangled states are still quite poorly 
  understood and this idea grows out of a specific experiment carried out to understand 
  them better. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000">To appreciate 
  how this is possible I will explain a number of important ideas from physics, 
  those familiar with these standard facts please be patient. The first is wave 
  particle duality. Light (or indeed all matter if you observe close enough at 
  a microscopic scale) possesses properties of waves and particles. It cannot 
  be both at once since these are fundamentally different but it will show one 
  or other of its characteristics depending on the situation. Generally light 
  behaves like a particle when it is created and again when it is absorbed. While 
  it is moving, it flies like a wave. There is one important exception I will 
  describe.</font></p>

      1 Two sources of waves in a ripple tank overlap to create interference patterns.

      calm zones. Where the peaks or troughs are in phase, they reinforce to produce 
      stronger waves.</font></td>

      2 Light from a laser passes through a double slit and produces an interference 
      pattern of light and dark bands. To achieve this each slit has to act as 
      a separate source of light. For sufficiently narrow slits, this is exactly 
      what happens; the light is diffracted as it passes throught the slits and 
      does not form a sharp shadow. Instead it spreads out like water waves and 
      interferes with light from the other slit.</font></td>

</table>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000">Imagine 
  first some ripples on a pond. (Fig 1) If I start my ripples by disturbing the 
  water at just one point near one side, they would spread as out as semi circles. 
  If I make more waves starting from a place close by to the first source, the 
  waves will spread out from this second point and as the waves cross over each 
  other they make a characteristic pattern called interference. It is a misleading 
  name as they interact in a very orderly way. Visual artists familiar with op 
  art may remember something called the moir&eacute; pattern. If you overlay two 
  parallels sets of lines, or concentric arcs of circles in this case, the lines 
  produce strong fringes where they overlay each other. The waves do the same 
  thing: where two peaks of a wave meet they reinforce, where a peak meets a trough 
  they cancel out. If you do an experiment with light waves which are microscopically 
  small and pass them through two narrow slits, interference patterns form and 
  are visible to the naked eye since they can be much larger than the waves that 
  produced them. It takes a little care to set the experiment up so that the pattern 
  is large enough to see but it is fairly easy using a laser. If we put a screen 
  behind the double slit for the light to fall on, then we would see a series 
  of fringes as shown in fig 2.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000">So far nothing 
  remarkable has happened. The strange bit comes next. According to one of the 
  theorems of quantum mechanics, Complementarity, we can never simultaneously 
  observe both the wave and particle like behaviour of light or anything else. 
  For example we might ask, suppose the light source is so faint that only one 
  photon at a time is present in the experiment, can a photon interfere with itself? 
  The answer is yes it can. But in that case, does that mean it splits into two 
  separate halves to pass through the two slits? Perhaps so, or rather two possible 
  versions of the photon, neither of which definitely exist move along two possible 
  paths, one going through each slit. Exactly how it does this is a great mystery: 
  if you try and watch which slit the photon passes through, it will pass through 
  only one slit and it will no longer interfere. If we keep watching, the photons 
  randomly pass through either slit but we would never see them divide. If we 
  use a time-lapse photo to record the pattern of light and all we would see are 
  two bright zones with no interference as shown in upper right graph of fig. 
  3. The photons seem to know when they are watched. This 'self-consciousness' 
  of the photon is a strange quantum mechanical property and it will be a key 
  feature of the time machine.</font></p>

        </b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Einstein was deeply 
        troubled by the problem of time. In the old way of understanding with 
        universal time and space, the present moment was unique and unambiguous. 
        Only the present really existed, the past was done and the future yet 
        to come. With the advent of Special Relativity this all changed, the present 
        moment was defined differently for each frame of reference. If I pace 
        up and down while I am thinking about this, I am changing my position 
        and velocity and my frame of reference. In a galaxy far far away, my estimate 
        of what day today is for the citizen of that far off place will be wobbling 
        around by more than a 100 years as I change the direction I walk in. The 
        bigger the distances involved and the bigger the velocity changes the 
        more marked these effects become. It only makes sense if we acknowledge 
        that the whole of space-time all coexists, but then how are we to understand 
        the special quality of the moment we call now? Einstein passionately believed 
        in causality, the strict temporal ordering of events. He tried to structure 
        special relativity so as to forbid it. The mathematical formalism prevents 
        matter and energy from accelerating to speeds faster than light, a neccessary 
        corollory, since anything going faster than light can also travel back 
        in time. What he missed was that there might be a way to transmit pure 
        information, unconnected with mass or energy. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And here is something 
        else to think about next time you are watching the stars: for star light, 
        time does not exist at all. From the frame of reference of the light, 
        it leaves its distant star and arrives here all in the same instant.</font></p>

  does the entanglement come in you are wondering? Imagine a mother is having 
  identical twins, but we do not know what sex they are beforehand. Once we know 
  the sex of one, the other will be the same. In the quantum world, we have to 
  imagine that our 'unborn' entangled photons are hermaphrodite. They have no 
  sex initially, but the sex does at some point become determined. It is not literally 
  sex but some property of the particle. There are different kinds of entanglement 
  and the strange quality they share is that although there is no way of knowing 
  in advance how this particular property will show itself, the entangled particles 
  seem to have some secret way of knowing each others behaviour so that it is 
  always correlates. In this case we will be looking at pairs of photons that 
  will either behave like waves or particles.</font></p>

        Choice Paradox</font></b></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000">The 
        physicist John Wheeler thought about the double slit experiment and asked 
        himself: what would happen if we did not decide whether to check which 
        way the photons went until after they had passed the slit, would they 
        still respond so as to show only their particle or wave identity but never 
        both at once? In a lab light moves so quickly it is hard to delay the 
        decision on how we are to measure it, but supposing the that we used a 
        light source that was a distant quasar, billions of light years away. 
        The light could have been traveling towards us for longer than the World 
        exists and yet apparently it still does not decide whether to behave like 
        a wave or a particle until it encounters some measuring apparatus. This 
        experiment, although it is probably impossible to carry out does not sound 
        to physicists as impossible as you might imagine. Some objects in the 
        universe bend light, indeed any large mass will. There are quasars known 
        that lie directly behind other galaxies so that their image is distorted 
        and magnified by passing a nearer galaxy on the way to our telescopes. 
        We would have to find a quasar where there were just two paths around 
        the intervening lensing object. The observer can adjust the relative path 
        length to get the light in phase by delaying the light arriving along 
        the shorter path by passing it through a suitable fibre optic. In practice 
        this might be impossible since the two paths might differ in length by 
        light years but no matter. This is a thought experiment. It is hard but 
        not impossible. Wheeler's delayed choice paradox has been with us for 
        many years. No one has refuted it. Has any one tested it? The answer is 
        yes, in 2001 there was an experiment that appears to confirm that the 
        light really does not 'decide' how it is going to travel until it gets 
        there. This was a laboratory set-up. It is did not involve star light 
        and the time period is only nanoseconds for the light to pass through 
        the apparatus. A short time but significant because the effect precedes 
        the cause.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000">I shall 
  begin by describing an idealised form of experiment; it is slightly different 
  from any experiment that has actually been carried out but easier to understand 
  and could be performed. (In fact Cramer has announced plans to do so.) Imagine 
  an experiment where entangled pairs of photons set off down two different paths. 
  Along each route, the light beams will pass through a double slit and then after 
  that they will go to some measuring apparatus. There are two routes, each with 
  their own identical double slit. We have to set up the experiment precisely 
  so that when a single photon passes through one of the slits, its entangled 
  partner will be passing through a slit in the other path. Everything described 
  so far will be exactly the same for each of the two paths; the routes are only 
  different when it comes to the measuring apparatus. Along the upper route we 
  provide a way to observe which of the double slits the individual photons pass 
  through. On the lower route, we simply gather the light without checking which 
  of the slits it passed through. The design of the apparatus allows us to choose 
  whether we see which way the light passed through the slits with a lens. If 
  it focuses the image of the slits, we see which way the light came, if it is 
  out of focus, we still measure the photons arriving, but no longer know which 
  slit they come through as the image is now blurred. In focus we see the two 
  slits, out of focus, the blurry but recognizable interference pattern will show. 
  </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000">The prediction 
  is that on the lower path, the entangled sister photons respond to what is happening 
  in the upper path and behave in the same way. If the light in the upper path 
  is being sharply focussed, there will be no fringes visible in the lower path 
  either. If the light in the upper path is out of focus and fringes are present, 
  then the fringes show in the lower path too. The entangled photons have to have 
  the same properties. They will either both behave like particles or both behave 
  like waves. This experiment is not the same as the Delayed Choice Paradox but 
  you can see that it relates to it. Wheeler suspected that the photons anticipate 
  how they will be detected and travel accordingly, either moving like waves or 
  particles. In the new experiment, we can change how we view one path and we 
  expect to find that the entangled partner photons respond to this change.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000">But now 
  here is the extra strange part of the experiment. The upper arm is longer than 
  the lower arm. The photons have to go further from the source to reach the detector. 
  The difference in length is not great but it is very important because the photons 
  in the short lower path have already arrived at their detector before the photons 
  in the upper arm have reached their detector and yet they still anticipate how 
  that detection is going to be made and behave accordingly. The measurement in 
  the longer path is forcing photons in the shorter arm to change their behaviour 
  even though the upper arm photons are still en route to their detector at the 
  moment the lower arm photons complete their journey.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000">An experiment 
  similar but not identical to the one I have described has already been carried 
  out. That experiment confirms definitely that the photons in the two paths are 
  connected in the way they respond to how they are observed; there is no doubt 
  about this connection. A controversy arises over the question of the timing 
  and the assertion that the lower arm anticipates the upper arm. The details 
  of the actual experiment involve an additional device called a coincidence detector. 
  In the real world, there are a lot of stray photons floating around, and in 
  order to distinguish the true entangled photon pairs from any other photons, 
  the coincidence detector records when two photons arrive at the detectors simultaneously, 
  or almost simultaneously and ignores all others. Since one light path is shorter, 
  photons will arrive a few nanoseconds earlier on the short path but this small 
  delay will still be recorded as a coincidence. This does not cause any confusion 
  since the number of photons is quite low and it might be a relatively long time; 
  say some 10 or 100s of microseconds before the next pair is recorded. Only coincident 
  photons are recorded, all others are ignored.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000">The real 
  experiment was carried out as part of Birgit Dopfer's Ph.D. in 1998. Her tutor, 
  Anton Zeilinger, is one of the world leaders in experimental optics and is well 
  aware that something interesting has been discovered but specifically denies 
  that the time difference is significant. Has he made a mistake or is there some 
  legitimate reason for ignoring it? Sometimes the Uncertainty Principle allows 
  this sort of thing to happen. Could this be the case here? If the answer were 
  yes we would anticipate that increasing the difference in the arm length would 
  destroy the correlation. The full technical details of the experiment are described 
  in German but as far as I can determine, the answer is no. This is a very important 
  point and something that was taken up by Ray Jensen who described the experiment 
  to John G Cramer. Ray Jensen was also the first to realise that using this result, 
  it is possible to design a time machine for information.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000">Just to 
  make this clearer, imagine another thought experiment, this time of my own invention. 
  Imagine if it was possible to carry out this 'two-armed' entangled light experiment 
  with one very long arm. I am on Pluto and I am receiving a steady stream of 
  entangled photons from a lab back on earth. Lets also assume that there are 
  a lot of photons flowing towards me, say millions per second and that I have 
  a gadget that very quickly can switch between observing them as waves or particles. 
  This clearly is not practical because I would have to have a telescope so good 
  that I could detect which slit the photons emerged from back on Earth. Impossible 
  but no matter, this is a thought experiment. I can now use this set up to send 
  my report using Morse code or any digital code I care to choose. The light that 
  I am receiving has taken about 4 hours to make it out to Pluto. We predict that 
  in the lab the light on the short path just crossing between bits of apparatus 
  will anticipate my message and receive it 4 hours before I send it! That sounds 
  crazy but that is time travel.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000">John G Cramer's 
  ambitions are a little less wild sounding but equally provocative. He intends 
  to extend the length of the upper arm by 10 kilometres using a pair of fibre 
  optic cables. They can be kept spooled up so all the equipment will sit happily 
  in one lab. With this amount of arm extension, the inverted delay is predicted 
  to be 50 microseconds. It does not sound like much but it will be an extraordinary 
  achievement. Until now the time shifts involved have been very small and so 
  far ignored. This still seems like a very short time but it is 10,000 times 
  longer than observed before. It will prove that the effect is not limited to 
  ultra short times only. It will open the gateway to building a time machine 
  for information. <br>

        Prediction</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The concept of a cascade 
        of small backward intervals of time was first explored by Isaac Asimov 
        in &quot;The Endochronic Properties of Resublimated Thiotimoline,&quot; 
        published in the March 1948 issue of Astounding Science Fiction and reprinted 
        in The Analog Anthology #1 (Davis, 1980). This was a spoof scientific 
        article. The article presents the description of fictitious substance 
        thiotimoline. Thiotimoline has the property that it dissolves 1.12 seconds 
        before the introduction of a solvent. Asimov further discusses telechronic 
        batteries. These use a series of cells containing thiotimoline connected 
        to each other through a process of adding water to extend the inverted 
        delay time over which the thiotimoline will dissolve. I quote: </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">'The principle behind 
        the telechronic battery is easy to understand and home experimenters will 
        have no trouble constructing their own. A test tube containing properly 
        purified thiotimoline is placed between a low-powered laser and a photoelectric 
        cell. When the thiotimoline dissolves, 1.12 seconds before the addition 
        of water, the formerly opaque thiotimoline becomes transparent and the 
        photoelectric cell is tripped. This in turn results in water being added 
        to another test tube containing thiotimoline. The thiotimoline in the 
        second test tube will, of course, dissolve 2.24 seconds before water was 
        added to the first tube. By cascading these &quot;endochronometers&quot; 
        it is possible to create a telechronic battery of any desired time constant. 
        Cascading 3215 endochronometers, for example, results in a battery in 
        which the last tube's thiotimoline dissolves about 1 hour before water 
        is added to the first tube.' </font><br>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The fictitious telechronic 
  batteries were limited in their ability to send an effect back through time 
  by the number of cells. The information they could send was only a single bit, 
  either they have or have not been exposed to solvent at a later point in time. 
  In the real world things will not be so limited. Even a 50 microsecond inverted 
  delay, with appropriate instrumentation becomes a very powerful discovery:</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><u>Given that it should 
  be possible to receive a packet of information before it is sent, we can choose 
  to re-send that same package back through time again and again. By re-sending 
  the information many times it can be sent back indefinitely. The information 
  can never be sent back to an earlier time than when this experiment first becomes 
  fully operational but having once opened the 'Time Gate', there is no limit 
  in principle to how far in the future information may come back to us from.</u></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This single experiment alone 
  leads to an entirely new world but it will take a lot to convince most physicists 
  and probably at least one other group of researchers will have to repeat the 
  experiment before it will be widely believed. The current culture in physics 
  is surprisingly conservative, there are only a very few researchers who would 
  risk their time and reputation on this venture. The consensus is that we already 
  know all the important ideas at the low energy levels associated with this kind 
  of experiment. The first shake up would come for physicists having to admit 
  that time had changed. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The really important consequences 
  for society as a whole are far greater and almost impossible to anticipate. 
  Some may view this as a threat, others as a new age. Whatever each individuals 
  view, society as a whole will respond and this may prove another key factor 
  in developments. It is my judgment that the technical difficulties in transforming 
  an initial experiment into a mature time technology will be relatively trivial. 
  If sufficient effort is brought to bear we can anticipate this would happen 
  within a matter of years. If for example the proof of principle is reached this 
  year, 2007, then by about 2012, the consequences would begin to be felt. What 
  do I have in mind? Well here is just one possibility:</font></p>

      <p><b><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Secret Time Gate</font></b></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Let us imagine a small 
        group of physicists decide to develop the Time Gate purely for their self 
        interest. We are all familiar with the short term volatility of the stock 
        market so as soon as the experiment is working well enough that it can 
        send back in time a reasonably large list of stock prices of over no more 
        than a few minutes, the project can begin in earnest. Using seed money 
        from their own small savings they put themselves into a position of unstoppable 
        advantage. We can assume these are very smart guys and they soon figure 
        out how to automate the whole process so that a computer compares current 
        prices with upcoming prices and then makes all the appropriate trades 
        constantly changing their portfolio in anticipation of each change. They 
        can be assured of frequent gains, no losses and gains coming almost every 
        few minutes. Whilst their portfolio remains small, their presence will 
        go unnoticed but it is the nature of exponential growth that it cannot 
        remain like that for long. </font> </p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Since they are a very 
        smart bunch of guys they can predict ahead using other means than the 
        Time Gate to give themselves some approximate idea of what will happen 
        further off in the future. By an adaptation of perturbation theory to 
        this special case, they will be able to anticipate when their presence 
        would be felt. This would happen when they become very major traders. 
        Before the market became aware that some major new force is eating up 
        shares unstoppably, their ability to anticipate a possible chaotic change 
        or collapse in share prices will allow them to shift strategy. By this 
        point they might well be the world's largest stockholders. This should 
        give them more than ample choice of where they want to go next.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">An idea introduced 
        by Hugh Everett as an alternative to the mysterious collapse of the wave 
        function in quantum mechanics. He showed that when the equations show 
        that several different events are possible, it can be argued that all 
        the possibilities happen, each in their own separate universe. This appears 
        to lead to an exponential number of new universes continuously being created, 
        including multiple copies of myself all writing slightly different versions 
        of this article. Max Tegmark dismisses the criticism that an exponential 
        number of new universes is being created. He argues that the number is 
        finite and that the parallel worlds are mostly very similar and frequently 
        merge as well. He considers the size not a problem at all. Viewed from 
        a timeless point of view, as Barbour would, all possible configurations 
        of the universe exist eternally so there is no growth at all. David Deutch, 
        who was responsible for much of the early theoretical research in quantum 
        computing also believes in the theory.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Many Worlds, if real, 
        could have a major impact on time travel as we would find ourselves in 
        contact with many different versions of the future. I suggest that it 
        would act as a fiter blocking certain types of information. Any variations 
        that are random, perhaps for example the future state of the stock market 
        as described above. We would receive messages from numerous different 
        versions of the future in which the stock prices did not agree. As a result 
        our instruments would not produce clear readings when we tried to access 
        this purely stochastic information. On the other hand a process that is 
        presently beyond human understanding but for which there is almost cetainly 
        is a perfectly good deterministic theory, say being able to perdict an 
        earthquake, the warning should come through very clearly as in any version 
        of the World that is substantially similar to this one, earthquakes will 
        still happen at the same moments.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The end of the age of capitalism 
  might just be one small step compared with what lies ahead. It would however 
  to be a mistake to assume tht this is an unavoidable conclusion. Not all information 
  about the future would become available to us, somethings may remain unknown. 
  (see Many Worlds) Exactly how this we will work is not yet understood. The concepts 
  of present and future would partly merge. There would be distinctions but not 
  as we know them today. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As soon as the time gate 
  technology comes becomes widely known, the rush will be on to retrieve information 
  from the future. Very quickly this will mushroom into a vast industry, the World 
  will be gripped by great excitement. It is hard, indeed impossible, for us to 
  imagine accurately now what this will feel like. It will be an extraordinary 
  period. The idea that the future is coming within view will be an intoxicant 
  for science, industry,commerce and the military. This will be seen as the biggest 
  idea ever.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">With thousands or in fact 
  millions of Time Gates opening up, we observe another key feature of retro-causality. 
  So long as advanced technical civilization exists, it will build Time Gates. 
  If the continuity of civilization is maintained unbroken information will continue 
  to be handed back over arbitrarily long intervals of time. We can infer that 
  rather a short time after the opening of the first Time Gates, an avalanche 
  effect will insure that we will start to receive information from further and 
  further into the future. The upper limit to the retro transmission of information 
  is set only by the longevity of that future technical society.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It is my prediction that 
  in the event the Cramer/Jensen experiment succeeds (or anyone else), there will 
  be a pause while others verify this work. There will be a further period while 
  we search really hard to find if there are any hidden factors preventing the 
  unrestricted use of the retro-causal data. If no such restrictions are found, 
  very shortly afterwards a great wave of excitement will engulf physicists. The 
  excitement will spread rapidly out from the physics community and the race will 
  be on to realise this dream. With a prize this great, the intensity of activity 
  would be unprecedented. Like the Moon Race, it would be a great engineering 
  feat, unlike the Moon Race, it would not necessarily be centrally organised. 
  There would be many different groups and organisations all scrambling to get 
  in on the action. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I cannot imagine anything 
  more utterly and totally extraordinary: the idea that I might live to, indeed 
  within a short number of years, be in a position to learn about the science, 
  technology and history of our near and distant future. This seems to belong 
  to a realm of pure fantasy but no so. At the very least we have brought this 
  within the reach of hard SF. And there is the remote, but not non zero probability 
  that this is about to happen. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Let us now consider another 
  kind of information arriving from the future: science and technology. Unlike 
  the stock prices this will remain accurate even after the information is freely 
  and openly available. We can imagine that in this situation, many workers will 
  seek to reproduce methods and results already known about in the future. This 
  introduces us to the yet another variant on the familiar paradoxes of time travel. 
  Is this the show stopper or can we still push ahead with this line of reasoning? 
  Who, it will be asked, originated an idea if the first to work on it learnt 
  about the concept in papers not yet published. Will they find their own names 
  on those papers or other? It looks like cheating. It must be admitted that there 
  are far more unanswered questions at this point than clear answers. The fact 
  that even a few physicist are prepared to countenance such ideas should be persuade 
  us to at least take seriously an idea that it would be only to easy to dismiss.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Richard Feynman 
        on Time</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Undoubtedly one of 
        the most influential physicists of the 20th century, arguably standing 
        second in line after Einstein, Feynman introduced the idea that we treat 
        antimatter as matter traveling backwards in time. It is one of the key 
        ideas that he used in developing the Feynman Diagrams that provide the 
        basic tool with which almost all particle physicists have worked with 
        ever since. His own view on quantum mechanics was that we should treat 
        particles and photons as capable of doing anything, indeed that they did 
        everything and they traveled on all possible paths open to them, multiple 
        copies of each fundamental particle simultaneously buzzing out in all 
        kinds or crazy ways. Light traveling in curved or twisted routes, even 
        moving backwards in time. You then sum all these possible histories together, 
        the math shows that most of them cancel out and out pops the <u>consistent 
        paths</u>. This is not just a crazy idea, he showed this is a perfect 
        way of predicting how experiments will behave. It solves for example the 
        double slit problem of how one photon can go through two slits.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">By a logical extension 
        of Feynman's consistent paths, the same rules can be applied to calculating 
        what can or cannot be done in time travel. Nick Herbert writes: 'Killing 
        your grandmother before your mother was born would create an inconsistent 
        history so is forbidden. What you would experience if you tried to kill 
        your grandmother would be strange quantum forces that magically prevent 
        this action from happening no matter how hard you tried. These quantum 
        forces would be similar to the Pauli Exclusion Principle for the electrons 
        that hold matter together. The Temporal Consistency Principle is a kind 
        of Pauli Principle acting through time rather than space.'</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I have described how an 
  experiment to detect retro-causal effects maybe carried out in the near future. 
  By Application of the 'Asimov Daisy Chain' any small inverted time delay can 
  be amplified by a factor in excess of a million, extending from microseconds 
  to minutes the shift in time. By industrial scale development of vast numbers 
  of 'Time Gates', subject to sharing this information, the second level of amplification 
  triggers an avalanche of information arriving from all our future histories 
  where Time Gates are in use. What might start as a 50 microsecond inverted delay 
  can grow to a giant.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We live in the post modernist 
  era. Intellectuals argue over the definition of this term or whether it really 
  has meaning at all but no one can deny that the quality of social change has 
  altered and that arguably this is a new era. It may however be but a brief interlude. 
  The age that we called modernism was characterised by the dominance of engineering 
  and the physical sciences literally re-moulding society. The landscape was first 
  changed by mechanised transport and the ease of travel. Later the arrival of 
  telecommuncations and computers provided enhanced access to information. Physics 
  played a key role in driving the engine of change. Along with the technical 
  change came tolerance, progressive politics and imaginative art and design. 
  Today innovation continues but physics plays little part in it. The last time 
  that physics shook the world is now more than 60 years in the past. It appears 
  that following the devastating vision of nuclear war, physicists took a vow 
  to detach themselves from everyday life. This is far from true, some passionately 
  argued the importance of a social conscience and the need to evaluate the impact 
  of research but for most the question was simply not relevant. They had moved 
  onto areas that had no conceivable application either in the near or longer 
  term future. They became involved with pure ideas, first successfully exploring 
  the properties of high energy particles and subsequently in pursuit of a unification 
  of all physical forces. Initially governments were happy to grant to physicists 
  almost unlimited freedom to choose their research but as the decades passed 
  and no new ideas emerged that lead to practical applications, the climate that 
  physicists found themselves working in has changed. Today there is a lively 
  focus of research around quantum computing and cryptography. This is perhaps 
  the only area where it looks hopeful that some important practical applications 
  of great consequence maybe found. Outside this specialist area, the prospects 
  for physics are not so good with the long sort after breakthrough in String 
  Theory not expected anytime soon. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Most physicists and serious 
  intellectuals would argue that ideas concerning time travel are wild conjecture 
  and prefer not to consider the subject. I suggest that there is good reason 
  to reflect upon this since even if the chances of a breakthrough are slim, the 
  consequences are so significant. Amongst cosmologists, Paul Davies and John 
  D Barrow have both recently put in writing that a breakthrough in time travel 
  is possible in the not too distant future. There others in this field who hold 
  the same views and some who have even gone to the length of designing time machines, 
  all be it, only as thought experiments. Most famous for this is Kip Thorne whose 
  proposal for using a worm whole held open with exotic matter stirred up a huge 
  debate. Thorne's ideas are based on general relativity, a subject where others 
  had already proved a number of time machine like solutions to the equations 
  existed. Einstein with his strict adherence to the principle of causality would 
  have been unhappy about it, but the mixture of special and general relativity 
  combinied with quantum mechanics creates a mixture of paradoxes that more than 
  likely can only be resolved by accepting the reality of some sort of time travel.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If this change comes it 
  will be the single largest influence on society that science has ever brought. 
  To my knowledge no writer, either serious or fictional, has succeeded in reflecting 
  upon the true impact that knowledge of the future will bring. The subject is 
  simply so huge as to overwhelm. It has the potential to transform our civilization 
  and take us into an era as different as today is from the stone age.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I will introduce a formalism 
  to concisely represent my conjecture concerning the social impact of time technology. 
  Following the form introduced by Barbour who refers to the singularity within 
  Platonia that corresponds to the Big Bang as 'The Alpha Point' and the speculative 
  cosmology of Barrow and Tippler, wherein the point at which consciousness gains 
  control over all matter and energy in all logically possible universes as 'Omega'. 
  I now posit a third point that I shall call 'The Mu Point'.</font> </p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><u><b>'The Mu Point' occurs 
  when consciousness, through application of retro-causal time communication, 
  gains objective knowledge of its future. </b></u></font></p>

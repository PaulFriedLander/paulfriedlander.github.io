  of the section of the article on Friedlander read as follows:</font></p>
<p>Nearby, the British artist, Paul Friedlander, is testing the light sculptures 
  for his installation Timeless Universe. In his own words, this former physics 
  student &quot;was brought up in Cambridge on a diet of relativity and black 
  holes, originally aimed at becoming a Cosmologist and an expert on interstellar 
  propulsion&quot;. At 56, with his piercing blue eyes, fringe of beard and tousled 
  grey hair, he has something of an air of Gyro Gearloose, Albert Einstein and 
  Steven Spielberg rolled into one. His suspended, spinning sculptures, upon which 
  are projected subtle and scholarly combinations of abstract images (words, figures, 
  mathematical symbols...), present themselves, when at rest, as giant, white 
  plastic mobiles. Lit and moving, they become mesmerising swirls of light which 
  seem to reveal new spatial dimensions... It should be mentioned that part of 
  the inspiration for these sculptures comes from the physicist Julian Barbour's 
  theory that time does not exist (The End of Time). Spectators often discover 
  mystical or magical elements in these installations.....</p>

<p>" THE FUTURE OF ART IS LIGHT "</p>
<p> -Henri Matisse </p>
<p>“Light is the closest we come to directly sensing the universal energy. The 
  chance interplay of form and color can inspire awe and wonder. “ -Paul Friedlander 
</p>
<p>Paul Friedlander creates kinetic sculpture, and interactive light installations 
  employing a knowledge of physics with a love of light. . His work is presented 
  as installations, often on a very large scale, consisting of long vertical undulating 
  light waves. He creates changes in color using 'chromastrobic light', resonating 
  with the undulating light forms. In one of the installations visitors can interact 
  through ultrasonic sound beams, which detect the positions of their bodies and 
  even subtle hand gestures. As they move, a range of events are triggered. Installations 
  are constructed without time constraints, changes occur whenever someone choices 
  to interact with the installation.</p>
<p> Explaining his work, Friedlander says "the inspiration came from a skipping 
  rope. I illuminated the ghostly form created by the rope spinning through the 
  air. To my surprise and fascination, an electrically driven version of this 
  produced not just a simple envelope but a great variety of harmonic and sometimes 
  chaotic patterns. I had discovered a frontier of science and art, exploring 
  a physical phenomena for artistic ends. Starting with desk top sized works, 
  I have extended the range and complexity of the pieces, building installations 
  with multiple ropes and computer controlled lighting systems up to 6 meters 
  high.</p>
<p> Integral to this work has been the use of chromastrobic light. Chromastrobic 
  light changes color faster than the eye can see. Persistence of vision causes 
  rapidly moving objects to leave multi-colored trails floating in the air.&quot;</p>
<p>Paul Friedlander has exhibited at The Singapore Science Center 2002, at the 
  Maisons des Arts in Malaysia 2001, the "Exit Festival" in Paris 2001, VideA_00 
  Festival in Barcelona 2000, “Nutopia” Cyberlounge London 2000, and won best 
  prize at “Lightforms" at the New York Science Muesem 1998. He was the stage 
  and lighting designer for the Electric Symphony Orchestra and has been commissioned 
  for permanent works for British Telecom, Technorama Museum, and SMS (Satellite 
  Media Services). </p>

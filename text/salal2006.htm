      <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When 
        I first encountered English physicist Julian Barbour's ideas, I was awed 
        by the intellectual courage. This was conjecture on the grand scale normally 
        encountered only in science fiction but carried out with mathematical 
        rigour that only a very few top physicists could achieve. The scale of 
        his ideas is truly breathtaking and often when reading his work one can 
        forget just what is involved. One idea I fell in love with early on is 
        what he calls 'the mists of Platonia'. </font></p>

    <td width="49%"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The installation 
      <i>Timeless Universe</i> is concerned with cosmology. My breadth of interest 
      ranges from ancient myths and legends to modern day work with mathematics 
      and physics. My approach is through written records, varying from ancient 
      scripts to signs, codes and mathematical formula. I take these images that 
      are so full of mystery and transform and fragment them using computer codes 
      I have written. The result is an endless kinetic stream of images which 
      never exactly repeats itself and refreshes itself on a daily basis so that 
      each day it starts again to weave a new variant on the themes I have programmed 
      into it.</font></td>

      signs of the presence of an otherwise unseen waveform, but a waveform so 
      vast and intricate that it spans across all possible conceivable states 
      of the universe and governs in every detail our fates. Trying to visualize 
      this waveform, I imagine something like the most beautiful finely feathered 
      fern, its leaves impossibly intricate with varied size and growth pattern 
      as we move our microscope over its endless reaches. </font></td>

      move towards realising that vision but the forms are infinitely simpler, 
      like one glimpse through the microscope, and in a way quite different from 
      the mists of Platonia that are perfectly still, where as my sculptures are 
      kinetic. I consider the installation <i>timeless universe</i> not to be 
      a representation of Barbour's ideas but rather a meditation inspired from 
      them. </font></td>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Central to Barbour's 
        thinking is a mathematical idea he calls Platonia. Let me give you an 
        analogy:</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">'Hold your thumb and 
        first finger about a cm apart and imagine a perfectly thin line running 
        between them. Next imagine holding a cm square of imaginary material with 
        no thickness between your thumb and finger. This square is infinitely 
        greater than the line. Now imagine holding a little cube of ordinary matter. 
        It is infinitely greater again. Repeat the process using your mathematical 
        imagination adding a 4th dimension. This is not the limit; we can go on 
        adding dimensions for ever. Imagine holding an infinitely dimensional 
        cube in the palm of your hand that is a new form of data storage. There 
        is enough memory to store a complete description of the universe in such 
        perfect detail that it records the position of every atom and particle 
        that exists. You have used 0% or your memory store so far, you may store 
        an infinite array of possible states of the universe. Now imagine using 
        a super electron microscope to look inside the data store, you are looking 
        at something that looks like a light sculpture, but can you imagine it?'</font></p>

        I am creating a piece that will change with time. As well as being kinetic, 
        the piece will vary from day to day. Data gathered from the internet are 
        re-arranged by computer programs each morning to weave into new patterns 
        of changing imagery. I feel that I have been true to Barbour's ideas since, 
        for his mission to succeed, he has to show how all our sense of change 
        and time passing, the past and future being so different and the present 
        moment special and unique arise from an underlying timeless reality.</font></p>

<BIG>Why Colonise Space? </BIG> 

<P><blockquote>
	As a child I dreamed of travelling to the stars, alone and in a spaceship of my own construction. When I was small, my father fed my imagination, making up bedtime stories about a character called Mr Muddle who built his own spaceship in his back garden and set off to visit the Moon and planets.
	 On Mr Muddle's first trip in his spaceship, he took off and after riding for many hours, he landed. It was night time. He decided to land in the night because he could see lots of stars so he knew he was in Space. It was extremely dark when he got out of the space ship and he could not see anything around him. He started to explore the planet he had arrived on very cautiously, feeling his way along. After a while he found a wall. Moving slowly along the wall he came  to what seemed to be a door. He opened it and went through into some where even darker. Moving around, he was struck by how oddly similar this was to going through his own back door and into his kitchen. 
<P>
Suddenly scared by the thought that he might wake up the aliens who lived in this house he made his way back through the door and to his nearby spaceship. He took off and flew for many hours until it was day time and knowing that he could find his way easily in the day, landed. Remarkably he found that his spaceship had landed exactly where he had built it in his back garden. He could not help having this nagging doubt that maybe he had not really taken off at all. 
	Well I am glad to report that in later stories Mr Muddle did take off and went onto make friends with many strange creatures, including the Mecks, who lived on the Moon, and the Wofilms and Seacoles of Mars and Venus.  In my imagination I or Mr Muddle travelled alone but I was certainly not the only one to have visions of travelling in space. I dream because I am fascinated by the idea of exploring space. Some dreams remain dreams, others become powerful ideas.

	I ask the question, why do we want to colonise space? This is a dream but it has the potential to become a powerful idea. We need to expand to provide living space and resources for humanity and we need to think about this carefully before we consider how we might go about it. If we know why we want to colonise space and if our reasons are strong enough, we will be in a much better position to convince others of the value of our mission. To answer that question I need to go back in time first. By understanding where the human race has come from we can understand where it MAY be going.

<P><blockquote>

	About 150,000 years ago a new breed of humans came out of Africa. Nothing remarkable in itself, different species of what were to become people had been emerging from Africa for several millions of years. During that time, several species of man had coexisted, evolved and died out again. This particular new strain was to prove different. Bone structure provides a basis for distinguishing species but alone it does not explain why this new variety was so different. Nor can we find convincing evidence in the archaeological records. Earlier species had tool making skills. Neanderthal man decorated his stone axes, showing aesthetic awareness He buried his dead, showing what some would describe as primitive religion. Homo Sapiens was different, we cannot say for sure why. Perhaps because he possessed a superior language organ. Perhaps that was the first great information revolution. Superior communication together with improved faculties for thought gave advantages more important than strength or an opposable thumb.
<P> 
	Within what was by evolutionary standards a relatively short space of time, about 120,000 years, Homo Sapiens had replaced all other species of man. What then happened, about 30 - 35,000 years ago, was the beginning of a process, still slow by modern standards, but remarkable by comparison with what had gone before.
	It is a mistake to think of primitive people as stupid or ignorant. On the basis of the fossil record, we have every reason to believe that the Homo sapien of 35,000 years ago was genetically equivalent to people today. They were the first true modern men. Amongst them there would have been a variety of skills and talent, and the finest would have been geniuses, every bit as much as Picasso or Einstein. Of the ancient Picasso's we are fortunate to have a remarkable record. With regard ancient science, we can only infer from what happened.

	For a period of 25,000 years men continued to lead a life not so different from his more ancient forebears. He was a hunter / gatherer. During this time, he must have become more and more knowledgeable in the essential skills of hunting and gathering. He did not just learn to make sharper and straighter spears, he or she must also have learnt more gentle skill. To gather you must know your plants well. You must know their habitats and what time of year to look for them. With hunting too, animals migrate along seasonal patterns and the best hunters would have been those who knew how to anticipate where to find their prey. Ancient people had very practical needs to study biology and astronomy.

<blockquote><P>
	Around 10,000 years ago this accumulation of knowledge was to lead to the next great technical invention after the stone tool: Agriculture. The impact of agriculture was so profound that we can say that it many ways it was the beginning of civilisation, the dawning of what would become ancient history began quite specifically with the invention of the plough.
	Why was the plough so crucial? It was the first great mass production tool. Since the beginning of life new species had emerged, their populations had expanded to fill a niche, and then, if they were lucky , it stabilised. More than that was impossible. Nothing had been different for man up till this moment. We too had emerged and expanded. But our numbers were tiny by modern standards, limited by the food supply. When agriculture first appeared it would have been a curiosity, of marginal impact. With the plough all this changed. It would not be an exaggeration to say that it was the most important invention ever. We have yet to test and prove another invention with such profound consequences. With the plough we were freed of our ancient constraint: the natural food supply. We could grow food, make artificial food if you like, not found in nature before, turning the countryside into a patchwork of fields and engaging in domesticating and breeding plants and animals. Ancient 'genetic engineering' transformed, for example grass, one of  nature's great success stories into weird mutants bearing giant seeds, ears of corn, ears of wheat.
<P>
	The plough produced something that had never existed before, a man made ability to generate a surplus. With surplus came growth not just of food but of population and the first concentrations of wealth, ancient cities. The clear signs of those ancient civilisations is found in the fertile crescent where the surplus came most easily.
	Change became rapid, the world began to be transformed quite literally by the hand of man. For thousands of years agriculture was the only significant technology other than the fashioning of stone tools.  Then with discovery of metals, came an improved plough and a further quickening of the pace of change.

<blockquote><P>
	For 10,000 years we have enjoyed the benefits of the plough and the civilisations that came with it. All that seemed to be needed was to spread the influence of this one development until now here we find ourselves in the very last days of the 20 th century, with only a handful of hunter gatherers left on the planet and all the rest of us utterly dependent on the plough and all that followed it for survival. And at this particular time we have run into a problem, a big problem.
<P>
	There is no room left to expand civilisation and only limited room left to improve the efficiency with which we use that space we have expanded into. After 10,000 years of growth, we have almost reached the end. The planet is full. There is no where left to go and no new continents left to conquer. We live in an age of prophets of doom, and where even the most optimistic of environmentalists can at best hope for a stabilisation of the situation, for an end to growth and equilibrium to be achieved. But can we bring growth to an end? Stop more than 10,000 years of momentum? From an evolutionary point of view we are talking not only about 10,000 years of human history but a natural history stretching back millions of years. The lesson from that is clear, nature is not in equilibrium. Everything changes, sometimes slowly and sometimes catastrophically. The green vision of a perfectly balanced harmony and coexistence is no more natural than anything else that has entered our imaginations. 
	Finally whilst on this point, I ask, is it even desirable to seek a limit to growth? What would a stable society be like? It has been a recurrent nightmare vision of the future conjured up by science fiction writers that a society that has reached equilibrium would have compulsory conformity and punishment of all innovation.  Perhaps stability itself is a poison to freedom of the mind and that the very things we hold dearest in a free society require unfettered growth. 
<P><blockquote>
	Now we are ready to answer the question Why colonise space? Consider the following notion, a thousand years from now a historian may write. "There really are only two inventions we need two consider to understand how the population rose from the level it had achieved while man was as yet another product of Darwin's inexorable process to where it is now. First the plough which took the human population from approximately 5 million to 5000 million and, second, the self sufficient space colony which further increased the population to today's level of 15000 million million."
<P></blockquote>
	If you are in any doubt about that last number, it is based on a very simple calculation, the assumption that the population will increase at the same rate it is currently expanding, approximately 1.5% per year, for a 1000 years. In the absence of any limits to growth, this is a conservative estimate. Past studies of population growth have shown that population can increase by as much as 10% per year if only the resources are available. This situation persisted for a while during the middle years of the last century throughout the American Frontier. Space too has the potential to become a high frontier, an area of almost unlimited resources and growth.
<P><blockquote>
	Finally I would like to mention a thought experiment made some years ago by the physicist, Freeman Dyson. If all the material forming the planets of our solar system could be rearranged  and reformed as a spherical shell  with a radius equal to the present distance from the Earth to the Sun, surrounding the sun, it would capture all of its light, almost exactly a billion times the amount presently falling on the Earth and provide a habitat of 100,000 million million square miles. Freeman Dyson made this thought experiment, not seriously, but as an explanation for a class of infra red emitting stars. If such artefacts as the Dyson Sphere exist, they will have a characteristic presence that can be identified by astronomers from many light years away. The  Dyson Sphere must lose waste heat and continue to emit exactly the amount of energy as the star it surrounds but it will be infra red radiation with a spectrum characteristic of a black body at the temperature most suited to the alien life forms that inhabit it. In the case of man and the sphere proposed above this would be around 15 degrees C. For any life form based on water, it would have to be in the range between zero and a hundred degrees C. Such infra red emitters are known but they are not believed to be signs of super advanced civilisations, rather they are stars in the process of formation, surrounded by gas and dust clouds, possibly in the process of condensing into new solar systems.
<P></blockquote> 
	The Dyson Sphere is not a practical blue print for how we might transform the Solar System in the next thousand years, none the less, his speculation is of great interest to us because we find, surprisingly, that not only is there a strong reason why we should want to colonise space but resources within our own cosmic backyard, the solar system, are more than sufficient for the most prodigious expansion of the human potential. Before we ever make the long journey to the stars, our civilisation may have grown a million fold or more and all because we learnt to live in Space.
	Now we understand why we want to colonise space, next we need to understand how. 
<P>
	For us to understand how we might live in Space, we will need to identify the resources we might realistically hope to use with technology we could build in the not so distant future. We will look to the Moon, with its plentiful supply of oxygen, silicon, aluminium and many other metals. We will look to the Asteroids, and in particular the Amor and Apollo group of Asteroids whose orbits conveniently come into the inner solar system, even grazing Earth's orbit. The Asteroids are a vast storehouse of material, including all the lighter elements, hydrogen, carbon and nitrogen. They provide all the elements necessary for life. 
<P>
 	Then we can say; we have turned that dream into a powerful idea.

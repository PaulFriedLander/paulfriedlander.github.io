<p><b>New York Exhibition Marries Art and Science</b></p>
<p>LightForms '98, an exhibition of interactive, light-based art, opens this month 
  at the New York Hall of Science. Organised by the non profit group Art &amp; 
  Science Collaborations Inc (ASCI), the show features three large-scale installations 
  chosen for both their scientific and aestheitc appeal.</p>
<p>British artist Paul Friedlander's &quot;Dark Matter&quot; is one of the featured 
  works. &quot;I'm an interdisciplinary person by nature,&quot; says Friedlander, 
  who holds bachelor's<img src="../images/dark00.jpg" width="400" height="320" align="right" vspace="16" hspace="8"> 
  degrees in both physics and fine art. &quot;I see my work as exploring the areas 
  of contact between art and science.&quot; As seen in the computer-rendered image 
  at right, the central element of &quot;Dark Matter&quot; is an undulating vaporous 
  waveform that rises seven meters from the floor. Friedlander created the effect 
  by illuminating a spinning rope with a high-power arc lamp reflected off a mylar 
  mirror. The arc lamp (on loan from the rock group Pink Floyd) has been configured 
  to shift color rapidly, in sync with the rope's rotation. When the rope rotates 
  fast enough (around 600 rpm), the human eye perceives a three dimensional multicolored 
  image. Visitors's can trigger changes in the sculpture's color and shape by 
  passing through a pair of SoundBeams, located in the triangular structure at 
  the lower right.</p>
<p>&quot;Dark Matter&quot; and the show's other works will be housed in the museum's 
  Great Hall., a setting that ASCI founder Cynthia Pannucci calls &quot;one of 
  the most appropriate spaces in the world for light art. Its like a homogenous 
  cave, or a cathedral.&quot; The only natural light entering the 24 metre high 
  interior is filtered through bits of cobalt blue glass imbedded in the walls.</p>
<p>LightForms '98 will run from 17 April through 31 May; museum interpreters will 
  be on hand to explain the science underlying each piece. The hall is located 
  in the Corona Park section of Queens, New York. Information is available at 
  the museums Web site, <a href="http://www.nyhallsci.org">http://www.nyhallsci.org</a>,

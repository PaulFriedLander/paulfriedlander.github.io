<p>A million miles away from the fast food style of the easyeverything.com cafes, 
  Nutopia is the novelle cuisine of cyberspace. Every ingredient of the futuristic 
  interior is designed to dazzle. No accident as principle designer Alastair Kay 
  specialises in film sets. Its 40 monitor room is diffused with aquamarine lighting, 
  giving an illusion of a submerged pool complete with two aquariums. And the 
  lounge is kitted out with the same futuristic furniture as the club Cream. But 
  the real innovation is Launchpad art space featuring work by fibre optic artists 
  Paul Friedlander, Jason Bruges and Ansel Thompson. A tad pretentious perhaps, 
  but at least there is not a geek in sight.</p>

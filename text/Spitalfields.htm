  Gate Sculpture</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Ancient 
  walled cities often have markets outside their major gates. In Jerusalem, for 
  example, a market is still to be found outside Damascus Gate, the most important 
  gate of the Old City. Roman London had six gates: Ludgate, Newgate, Aldersgate, 
  Cripplegate, Bishopsgate and Aldgate. The walls stood for over a thousand years, 
  being added to and partly rebuilt during that time. Bishopsgate leading out 
  to the Old North Road, also known as Ermine Street, was one of the most important 
  gates as it opened to a major route. Spitalfields was established in the mid 
  17th century a short distance outside the City wall close to the Old North Road 
  and Bishopsgate. At that time the walls were still intact and it was not until 
  nearly 100 years later in 1760 that most of the walls and Bishopsgate were demolished.

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Today little 
  remains of the London Wall and nothing is left of the gates except a reminder 
  of their former existence preserved in place names. Rather than trying to design 
  a sculpture nostalgically reflecting the styles of the past, I choose to preserve 
  only the enduring idea of a gateway. To create a connection with the past, and 
  an ongoing sense of progress into the future, I propose a symbolic futuristic 
  arch, representing both Spitalfields connection to its past and its intention 
  to adapt to the future. </font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF">This 
        remarkable festival and conference answered this question in many ways, 
        bringing together diverse practitioners, including artists, composers, 
        and other experts in the field. </font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There 
        was a fascinating collection of films showing works of early experimental 
        film makers. The conference presented the ideas of current practitioners, 
        and a series of concerts and installations presented the work.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF">I 
        presented my HyperSphere, with a new much enhanced 3D projection. I wrote 
        the software while in Thailand. It uses OpenGL to create virtual forms 
        with images taken in Thailand, and transforms them into an abstract flow. 
        I call the software Cubism because it re-explores the process of using 
        images from the everyday world and 'abstracts' them. I chose to use a 
        square, or large number of squares, which I textured with the images. 
        Initially I stepped outside the room I was working in and took some pictures 
        of a mango tree growing there. Later I added images from other parts of 
        Thailand. Ancient ruins, statues of the Buddha, waterfalls, an old gateway, 
        a ride on a ferry at dusk across the Bangkok river, a Karen tribal house 
        and much more. I chose images that had interesting textures, colours and 
        contrasts. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF">I 
        constructed a method to move the squares in a random walk within a cubic 
        lattice. Later I added a tessalated surface which I could undulate, but 
        still all made from squares. The program generates animation in real time 
        at high resolution, producing an hour long show, which then replays with 
        variations generated by the computer. This new work was shown together 
        with a version of The Wave Equation.</font></p>

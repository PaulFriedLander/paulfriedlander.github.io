<h3>When I was younger I was wary of explaining myself.  Experiencing the art is key, if the viewer needs a description, she or he may  be ignoring their own feelings. Still if anyone is going to do the explaining,  the artist is a good voice to listen to and over the years I have changed my  views and am now happy to talk or write about my work. My art is made from many  elements, a hybrid of methods, some inspired by art and science, others picked  up along the route, my time spent in stage lighting and the avant-garde  extending beyond visual art.</h3>
<h3><br />
  There is also photography and writing computer code.  This last interest is hardly typical for an  artist, but  it is one of my most serious passions, something I  discovered I had a flare for when I was an art student, ignored for many decades, and returned  to at a critical time in the development of my work that coincided with the arrival of the personal computer. Programming  is a continuing test for my logical  and  scientific side, I enjoy the challenge. It is also an expression of my love for certain forms, waves  more than anything, which can take on so many variations when explored in the virtual realm of the computer.  All the shapes you see in the video and the following pages were created by modelling the behaviour of waves mathematically.</h3>
<h3><br />
  When I am not busy working on some large scale installation,  I like to take time to write  computer code and in the process, I create much  art that often goes unseen. Here I show just a little of this.  The short clip is from a virtual world I constructed as part of my continuing research into waveforms. It is has no particular time limit. I could spend all day steering my  virtual camera round in this landscape, hunting down beautiful combinations of  colour, light and form. While the starting material is code, the three  dimensional shapes need to be textured so  they are  not just wireframes. This is where photography comes into play. I have a collection  of many thousands of photos, mostly documenting my work or nature.  A few clicks can turn a fiery landscape to  a watery or earthy one. A satisfying part of the process is to explore each option to find what is most  intriguing or beautiful. Just occasionally, even though my starting material is non-figurative,  faces and forms emerge from the designs like magical spirits. The human  imagination is a powerful pattern recogniser, and I surprise myself sometimes  with what I find.</h3>

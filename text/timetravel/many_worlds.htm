<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="+4">Many Worlds</font></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Many Worlds or the multiverse was 
  conceived by Hugh Everett as an interpretation of quantum mechanics. He proposed 
  it as a way to make quantum mechanics deterministic and to avoid the collapse 
  of the wave function. He argued that when the wave function shows that several 
  different events are possible, it could be argued that all the possibilities 
  happen, each in their own separate state. This interpretation would preserve 
  the unitary development of the wave function in a smooth and continuous way 
  so that quantum mechanics does not imply random processes are fundamental. What 
  remains as random is which particular state of the universe we happen to find 
  ourselves in. The original idea which he called the relative states formulation 
  was mathematically incomplete. The major problem was to show how a probability 
  distribution can be converted into a distribution of possible alternate worlds, 
  since in practice the splitting is rarely so straight forward as a quanta choosing 
  either one or other of two options, and the choices are weighted probabilities 
  with a varying density distribution of possible events. Each of these possibilities 
  then generates more universes in proportion to how likely each possibility is 
  to occur. The idea was taken up by Bryce DeWitt who was the first to call it 
  the Many Worlds interpretation and subsequently by a number of other physicists. 
  The original concept, with the addition of some extra mathematical rigour, remains 
  the same as when Everett first proposed it.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Branching leads to an exponential 
  number of new universes continuously being created, including multiple copies 
  of myself all writing slightly different versions of this article. Max Tegmark 
  dismisses this as being a criticism. He argues that the number of universes 
  is finite and that the parallel worlds are mostly very similar and frequently 
  merge on the microscopic scale. Once they have become significantly different 
  however they can no longer merge but still he considers the number of universes 
  not a problem. Viewed from a timeless point of view, as Julian Barbour would, 
  all possible configurations of the universe exist eternally so there is no growth 
  at all. David Deutsch, who pioneered the early theoretical research in quantum 
  computing, is also a strong supporter of the multiverse. He argues that the 
  development of quantum computers is evidence in its favour as the power of the 
  qubit depends upon its ability to interact with itself in those other universes. 
  </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Supporters of Many Worlds dismiss 
  criticisms based on Ockham's razor. Tegmark sites the historical precedent that 
  when Bruno proposed that the stars were distant suns, it was attacked as being 
  not consistent with Ockham's razor. He argues that the theory is more economical 
  with assumptions that form the basis on which quantum mechanics is built. While 
  strictly true that we may may draw an analogy between stars being suns and the 
  existence of other universes, this is a distraction from the very real criticisms 
  that can be raised. I would point out that Many Worlds massively violates conservation 
  of energy and every other conservation law besides. Also without adding on the 
  extra assumption that gravity must be quantised and hence localised within each 
  universe, the force of gravity would permeate all the universes and the multiverse 
  would rapidly collapse. Deutsch's argument based on the power of the quantum 
  computer could also be turned around to express how little we understand about 
  the quantum nature of reality. The quantum computer is closely modeled on the 
  Turing machine. Both the Turing machine and the quantum computer use the concept 
  of computability and that all problems are in principle computable. Roger Penrose 
  strongly disagrees with this and puts forward a powerful case in The Emperor's 
  New Mind that human intelligence is not any form of Turing machine. Of all the 
  arguments in favour of Many Worlds, Barbour's timeless vision is most persuasive 
  but leaves itself open to arguments about how we can understand timelessness 
  itself. What becomes of ideas such 'development' or 'process' or 'causality' 
  if every possible state of the universe already preexists? </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> When I first started thinking about 
  time travel I expected to find that we live in a multiverse. The alternative 
  appeared to be that if time travel is possible in a singe universe, it must 
  be perfectly deterministic but this has been ruled out by quantum mechanics 
  which is intrinsically non deterministic. Today I am not so sure. The multiverse 
  appears to be necessary but is itself problematic and in conflict with the experimental 
  proposal under consideration for reasons I shall return to shortly. First let 
  us see how it can help us understand how time travel might not lead to paradox.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Let us consider information arriving 
  from the future concerned with science and technology. We can imagine that in 
  this situation, many workers will seek to reproduce methods and results already 
  known about in the future. This introduces us to one variant on the paradoxes 
  of time travel. Who, it will be asked, originated an idea if the first to work 
  on it learnt about the concept in papers not yet published. Will they find their 
  own names on those papers or other? It looks like cheating, but it is not. Knowledge 
  discovered in a parallel universe is arriving in ours. By creating pathways 
  between universes we access the combined resources of all those linked worlds. 
  If for, example, we are presented with a future map of the world showing how 
  ocean levels have risen, this is not our future, but another future. Along with 
  the map will come information regarding future technologies originated in those 
  other worlds. They may be more sustainable and perhaps we can create a better 
  future by putting them into practice sooner. There is no contradiction, we are 
  choosing a different pathway along the many branches of the multiverse based 
  on our greater knowledge. We only receive messages from other futures, our own 
  future remains as mysterious and unknown as ever.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There is however a conflict between 
  the Many Worlds theory and the proposal for transporting information back through 
  time. The specific mechanism proposed depends on the existence of non locality. 
  Non locality, the idea that a quantum event in one place or time can influence 
  an entangled event far from it is an intrinsic 'weird' feature of standard quantum 
  mechanics and an implicit part of Wheeler's Delayed Choice Paradox. In Many 
  Worlds, non locality does not exist. The apparent 'spooky actions at a distance' 
  can all be accounted for, so it is claimed, by straightforward means. If the 
  research project discussed here is successful, information will be sent back 
  through time, and that signal will be arriving in a different parallel world, 
  but the Many Worlds theory forbids non locality so it will predict that it is 
  impossible to send the signal. We will have a result which no current theory 
  can explain. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I conjecture that there maybe a variant 
  of the Many Worlds theory that can allow non locality and hence our signals 
  to be sent. We can test to see if Many Worlds exist as they will act as a filter 
  blocking certain types of information from being sent back from the future. 
  We would receive messages from numerous different versions of the future and 
  any variations that are purely random, perhaps for example the future state 
  of the stock market as described in Implications, would become blurred by the 
  overlapping of the different messages. Our instruments would produce ambiguous 
  readings. In contrast a process that is presently beyond human understanding 
  but for which there is almost certainly is a perfectly good deterministic theory, 
  say being able to predict earthquakes, the warning should come through very 
  clearly as in any version of the World that is substantially similar to this 
  one, earthquakes will still happen at the same moments. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In general I am predicting that if 
  Many Worlds exists, the specific way information can be sent will determine 
  what information we can receive and what gets scrambled in its journey from 
  the future. If on the hand, we find that there is no scrambling of the signal 
  and that even intrinsically random messages arrive completely clearly, we can 
  conclude that Many Worlds do not exist. </font></p>

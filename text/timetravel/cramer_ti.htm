<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 1986 John G Cramer published a 
  new interpretation of quantum mechanics (QM), the Transactional Interpretation 
  (TI). It is particularly relevant for understanding how light propagates. Imagine, 
  he says, that light travels not just in the one direction we are used to from 
  the source and forward in time but that there is additional 'acceptor' wave 
  travelling backwards through time from the where the light is absorbed. It is 
  by the transaction of both waves moving between source and where it is absorbed 
  that the energy of the photon is transferred. This is a form of time travel 
  that is hidden from the observer under all normal conditions but none the less 
  is happening all the time. It would be the normal way that light propagates 
  in nature, irrespective of any special conditions imposed on how it is emitted 
  or absorbed. The development of TI grew out of an earlier idea first proposed 
  by Wheeler and Feynman called Absorber Theory and worked on by Hoyle, Narlikar 
  and Cramer in which they consider classical electromagnetic waves travelling 
  both forwards and backwards in time. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">An interpretation of QM is intended 
  to give a concept of what is happening to the quanta, something that QM itself 
  does not do as it is a statistical theory but interpretations do not make new 
  predictions. Most physicists have not been persuaded to take TI seriously, the 
  majority still follow the Copenhagen Interpretation (CI). In personal communications 
  with other scientists, I have received some negative responses to TI. Nick Herbert 
  has his doubts about it and Brandon Carter went so far as to describe it as 
  'dodgy'. Cramer is fighting a lonely battle, I compliment him for his courage 
  and determination. In 2003 he reanalyzed a another new quantum mystery, the 
  Ashfar Experiment, and claims that TI offers a betters explanation than either 
  CI or The Many Worlds.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now Cramer has taken the bold step 
  of announcing that he will try by experiment to prove information can travel 
  backwards through time but even if he succeeds it does not necessarily follow 
  that physicists would accept it as evidence in favour of TI. There maybe other 
  ways to understand the result. I have my own doubts about TI as I suspect that 
  if we can use information sent back from the future, this discovery could go 
  hand in hand with confirming that there are Many Worlds. TI as it is formulated 
  at the moment is not a Many Worlds theory. I wonder if the insights it brings 
  can be applied to a Many Worlds theory? </font></p>

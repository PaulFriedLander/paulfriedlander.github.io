<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="7">Theory</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For time time travel to be possible, 
  we must find a resolution to the fundamental paradox of time travel. This can 
  be stated in many ways, here is an example sent by a friend:</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We build a 'back in time' communicator 
  with a healthy delay of several minutes between two adjacent rooms A and B. 
  I send you, in room A, a message from the future in room B. You then march swiftly 
  into room B before I have sent the message and make sure that I send a different 
  message. This paradox seems to imply that there is a missing ingredient to do 
  with 'isolated systems' or even conscious interference....</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This problem is profound. The evidence 
  coming from experiments is strong. The interpretation of those experiments is 
  based on standard quantum mechanics. An alternative resolution to the implications 
  of the experiments is that standard quantum mechanics is wrong. If that is the 
  case, further experiments will not reveal how to build a time machine, but will 
  become an instrument to probe errors in standard quantum mechanics. We simply 
  do not have enough evidence to say what is going to happen. We stand at a very 
  interesting point. Either time travel is possible or standard quantum mechanics 
  will have to be modified or perhaps both time travel is possible and standard 
  quantum mechanics will have to be modified.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Let us look at ways to solve the 
  paradox. I have identified four general approaches.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">1. The Many Worlds Approach. Lets 
  work through what happens in the above scenario. Assume I am the man in room 
  A who will change the message sent from room B. Once I have changed the message, 
  what can I say about my past. I have a record of receiving a different message 
  to the one I know was sent, therefore I conclude that there is another world 
  in which another version of reality occurrs in which the original message was 
  sent unchanged. The world splits and I cannot ever meet myself in that other 
  world. But if I consider the situation at the moment I received the message, 
  there were two versions of the future, one sending the original message and 
  one sending the modified message. At the point where I receive the message, 
  I cannot distinguish between those two possible future worlds, because there 
  is no way of predicting in advance whether I change the message. I might not 
  even have decided what I intend to do and take my action on impulse. Therefore 
  I should receive messages from both versions of the future. In standard quantum 
  mechanical terms this might look like a superposition of messages, that we know 
  will 'collapse' into a single state when we receive it. The situation with the 
  actual proposed form of signaling is that each individual bit of the message 
  is constructed by averaging over several quantum events. Any message will require 
  us to interpret a large number of quantum events and these are equally likely 
  to be caused by either future. The message received will be a mixture of the 
  two: a scrambled mess. Many Worlds, at least in its standard form, does not 
  resolve the paradox.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">2. The Hermetic approach. Perhaps 
  room B, where the sender equipment is located, has to be isolated to make it 
  impossible for me to alter the message. This approach would require that we 
  invent some foolproof setup that guarantees that nothing I do can change the 
  message. Two criticisms at once spring to mind. One, how does the quantum system 
  sending the message 'know' that it is in an isolated and protected environment. 
  In technical jargon, how do we entangle the wave function of the quantum phenomena 
  sending the signal with that of the protective environment? Two, how do we protect 
  against the inevitable fallible nature of human efforts? Even if the sender 
  system is setup light years away so there is no chance of my interfering, nothing 
  humans do is ever perfect, how can we be sure this system performs faultlessly?</font> 
</p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">3. The Consciousness Approach. Perhaps 
  it is something to do with human nature, perhaps if we have pure intentions 
  or temporarily lose our free will or perhaps we do not have free will at all, 
  then we will never interfere with the message sent. A criticism arises because 
  we can recast the paradox removing me and replacing the process of making a 
  decision as to whether to change the message with an automated mechanism that 
  uses a random process to decide. If consciousness is involved at all, it must 
  be because there is no such thing as a random process, randomness must be an 
  illusion and our actions, like all actions, are predetermined. Perhaps we need 
  to look to Buddhism for deeper insight into the nature of being.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">4 Reinventing rational knowledge. 
  It can be shown that standard quantum mechanics without time travel, is inconsistent 
  at a quantum level with either logic or reality existing. We have to abandon 
  one of the two: logic or reality. Given this stark choice, some theorists have 
  begun to wonder whether there is something wrong with logic. The kind of logic 
  used in the foundations of conventional mathematics, based on the Boolean concept 
  of truth or falsehood excludes any middle. We are not allowed to say that something 
  is a little bit true or that is fifty percent true and fifty percent false, 
  etc. The alternative approach being explored under the general name of Topus 
  Theory is a branch of pure mathematics that allows other logical possibilities 
  to exist. Some of these 'topoi' apply to quantum mechanics. They are all very 
  abstract and hard even for specialists to understand. No one knows at the moment 
  if this approach will lead anywhere but it offers the hope that entirely new 
  forms of mathematics are emerging that might give more insight into these intractable 
  foundational problems. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Perhaps none of the four approaches 
  alone can solve the problem but a mixture of them will. The least hopeful is 
  the hermetic approach, which can probably be abandoned. A necessary requirement 
  of any solution using standard logic is that it must contains some form of Many 
  Worlds. It is not clear to me that any 'topoi' will alter that conclusion. Buddhism 
  might help us to the extent that we are more able to intuit a reality in which 
  space and time are not fundamental. My hunch is that whatever we discover, it 
  will be experiment that leads the way and that we will discover time travel 
  is possible and some variant of Many Worlds is correct.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="7">Is Time Travel Possible?</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">My interest in the subject of time 
  travel was triggered by reading an article in 28 September 2006 New Scientist 
  claiming that not only might time travel be possible but that experiments within 
  the near future could confirm this. The physicist making this claim, John G 
  Cramer, is already well known for producing his own interpretation of quantum 
  mechanics. I was intrigued and became very excited by this possibility. This 
  is certainly not the first time that serious scientists have discussed time 
  travel but it is I believe the first time their ideas went beyond thought experiments 
  with little or no hope of being tested. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This idea comes directly from experiment. 
  An interesting discovery that has been talked about but its implications not 
  yet explored. Those implications are so surprising that most physicists appear 
  to have been avoiding them. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I have organised this section of 
  my website as follows. In <a href="experiment.htm">Experiment</a> I explain 
  how nano-interval time travel may already have been created by accident and 
  I describe John G Cramer's proposals. I analyse them and agree that they do 
  really offer a way to transmit information instantly or back through time.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the brief pages following I contextualize 
  the subject showing how developments in physics have been leading in the direction 
  of time travel for a 100 years. The clues are all there in the subject. The 
  relevance of the one science fiction page, <a href="asimov.htm">Asimov</a>, 
  will become apparent in the following section, <a href="time_gate.htm">Time 
  Gate</a>, where I discuss what happens if Cramer's proposed experiments succeed 
  and how to build a device for transmitting information backwards through time.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I interpret the implications of this 
  research for physics in Theory. <a href="implications.htm">Implications</a> 
  explores the consequences of this discovery for the whole of society. This page 
  along with the final page, Omnipresence is written in a much more speculative 
  state of mind. Time travel, if it is coming, is going to change the World far 
  more than we can possibly imagine at this moment. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I would encourage feedback, intelligent 
  comments and criticisms are most welcome. email <a href="mailto:pzf@paulfriedlander.com">Paul 
  Friedlander</a></font></p>

  were kind enough to reply to my inquiries on this and other related subjects

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For time time travel to be possible, 
  we must find a resolution to the fundamental paradox of time travel. This can 
  be stated in many ways, here is an example sent by a friend:</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We build a 'back in time' communicator 
  with a healthy delay of several minutes between two adjacent rooms A and B. 
  I send you, in room A, a message from the future in room B. You then march swiftly 
  into room B before I have sent the message and make sure that I send a different 
  message. This paradox seems to imply that there is a missing ingredient to do 
  with 'isolated systems' or even conscious interference....</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Let us look at ways to solve the 
  paradox. I have identified four general approaches.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">1. The Multiverse Approach. Lets 
  work through what happens in the above scenario. Assume I am the man in room 
  A who will change the message sent from room B. Once I have changed the message, 
  what can I say about my past. I have a record of receiving a different message 
  to the one I know was sent, therefore I conclude that there is another world 
  in which another version of reality occurs in which the original message was 
  sent unchanged. The world splits and I cannot ever meet myself in that other 
  world. But if I consider the situation at the moment I received the message, 
  there were two versions of the future, one sending the original message and 
  one sending the modified message. At the point where I receive the message, 
  I cannot distinguish between those two possible future worlds, because there 
  is no way of predicting in advance whether I change the message. I might not 
  even have decided what I intend to do and take my action on impulse. Therefore 
  I should receive messages from both versions of the future. The situation with 
  the actual proposed form of signaling is that each individual bit of the message 
  is constructed by averaging over several quantum events. Any message will require 
  us to interpret a large number of quantum events and these are equally likely 
  to be caused by either future. The message received will be a mixture of the 
  two: a scrambled mess. The multiverse does not appear to resolve the paradox.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">2. The Hermetic approach. Perhaps 
  room B, where the sender equipment is located, has to be isolated to make it 
  impossible for me to alter the message. This approach would require that we 
  invent some foolproof setup that guarantees that nothing I do can change the 
  message. Two criticisms at once spring to mind. One, how does the quantum system 
  sending the message 'know' that it is in an isolated and protected environment. 
  In technical jargon, how do we entangle the wave function of the quantum phenomena 
  sending the signal with that of the protective environment? Two, how do we protect 
  against the inevitable fallible nature of human efforts? Even if the sender 
  system is setup light years away so there is no chance of my interfering, nothing 
  humans do is ever perfect, how can we be sure this system performs faultlessly?</font> 
</p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">3. The Consciousness Approach. Perhaps 
  it is something to do with human nature, perhaps if we have pure intentions 
  or temporarily lose our free will or perhaps we do not have free will at all, 
  then we will never interfere with the message sent. A criticism arises because 
  we can recast the paradox removing me and replacing the process of making a 
  decision as to whether to change the message with an automated mechanism that 
  uses a random process to decide. A counter criticism would assert that the automated 
  random process is not equivalent to a person being present and that it is sufficient 
  to have pure intentions not to interfere with the message to resolve the paradox. 
  Perhaps we need to look to Buddhism for deeper insight into the nature of being. 
  </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">4. Reinventing rational knowledge. 
  It can be argued that standard quantum mechanics without time travel, is inconsistent 
  at a quantum level with either logic or reality existing. We have to abandon 
  one of the two: logic or reality. Given this stark choice, Chris Isham has begun 
  to wonder whether conventional logic is inappropriate in the quantum realm. 
  The kind of logic used in the foundations of mathematics, based on the Boolean 
  concept of truth or falsehood excludes any middle. We cannot say that something 
  is a little bit true or that is fifty percent true and fifty percent false, 
  etc. The alternative approach being explored under the general name of Topus 
  Theory is a branch of pure mathematics that allows other logical possibilities 
  to exist. Some of these 'topoi' can be applied to quantum mechanics. They are 
  all very abstract and hard even for specialists to understand. No one knows 
  at the moment if this approach will lead anywhere but it offers the hope that 
  entirely new forms of mathematics are emerging that might give more insight. 
  </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Perhaps none of the four approaches 
  alone can solve the problem but a mixture of them does. Lets try and see how 
  it might work. If we receive a message from the future and possess free will, 
  that message cannot be arriving from our future, it comes from a similar but 
  not identical world. We can see that this must be true because the moment we 
  receive a message, we have choice in how we react and the message would have 
  little value if we did not not. For example if the message is warning that an 
  earthquake is about to strike, we would want to take action to minimise our 
  risk. It appears the multiverse must exist, it is a necessary requirement of 
  any solution using standard logic and the expectation that we have free will. 
  It is not clear to me that topos theory will alter that conclusion. It has a 
  precedent amongst a group of mathematicians called intuitionists. They tried 
  to find a way to incorporate the excluded middle and never succeeded. Perhaps 
  Topos theory will now accomplish something where they failed, we shall have 
  to wait and see. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Buddhism might help us be able to 
  intuit a reality in which space and time are not fundamental and develop the 
  pure intentions to operate this delicate process. While it may help, I do not 
  believe it is necessary, but our intentions cannot be dismissed in considering 
  the paradox. The automated random process is not equivalent to our being free 
  to make a decision, free will exists but is always conditional. We cannot do 
  absolutely anything we like. We have to choose between possible options, or 
  have the imagination to think of something else that is also possible. Whilst 
  it is true that if a purely random process chooses the message, the results 
  will be scrambled in the multiverse, this does not prove that the paradox stands. 
  That shows that messages might not be received under all possible conditions. 
  We can choose what message is sent by having the intention not to interfere 
  or through the hermetic approach, physically making it difficult to interfere. 
  While our intentions or the hermetic precautions may never be perfect, they 
  can be be sufficient to insure that the undisturbed message is received in the 
  majority of universes. If we happen to find ourselves in one of the universes 
  in which the message becomes scrambled, we will put that down to a perfectly 
  normal equipment malfunction. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There still remains a further problem. 
  <a href="many_worlds.htm">Many Worlds</a> denies the existence of non locality, 
  but the specific method proposed to send signals back through time depends on 
  non locality. A successful outcome to this experiment will precipitate a crisis 
  in physics as no interpretation of quantum mechanics can explain the phenomenon. 
  Physicists will be forced back to the drawing board. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This problem is profound. The evidence 
  coming from the Dopfer experiment is provocative. The interpretation I have 
  presented is based on standard quantum mechanics. An alternative resolution 
  to the implications of the experiments is that standard quantum mechanics is 
  wrong. If that is the case, further experiments might not reveal how to build 
  a time machine for information, but will become an instrument to probe errors 
  in standard quantum mechanics. We simply do not have enough evidence to say 
  what is going to happen. We stand at a very interesting point. Either time travel 
  is impossible but even so standard quantum mechanics will have to be modified, 
  or time travel is possible and quantum mechanics will have to be modified. Any 
  clear outcome to the proposed experiments will present a theoretical challenge. 
  The moment we observe interference fringes whose visibility can be modified 
  by a remote action to their entangled partners, the need to understand what 
  is happening becomes intense.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As an artist I have always had the 
  intuition that I am already in contact with the future. My suspicion is that 
  receiving information from the future is one of the senses of the unconscious 
  mind. Most people do not notice if it happens or do not have the gift, but precognition, 
  in one form or another is widely recognised outside the world of hard science. 
  For many people ideas come in dreams but it can happen just as easily when we 
  are wide awake. I would not pretend to be able to will this sense or direct 
  it in any way yet I feel convinced that it has been a channel for inspiration, 
  and on at least one occasion for more direct information too. Today this would 
  be considered a profoundly irrational and unscientific statement. It is my judgment 
  that my personal intuition is correct and that one day we will have a scientific 
  understanding of these mental phenomena that are presently considered beyond 
  the pale. Perhaps this research on time will lead to new theoretical insight 
  that resolves the mystery of precognition.</font></p>

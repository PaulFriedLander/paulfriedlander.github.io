      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Crucial Breakthrough?</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 1998 Dirgit Dopfer published 
        her PhD thesis in which she described the discovery of a new form of entanglement. 
        It has long been known that photons in a double slit experiment will behave 
        differently depending on whether or not observations are made on which 
        slit they pass through. Dopfer's experiment showed that this change in 
        behaviour from wave like to particle like is communicated to the entangled 
        partner. This is a remarkable discovery. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Previously with polarisation 
        entanglement used in experiments on the violation of the Bell Inequality, 
        only the correlations between observations reveal the entangled connection. 
        With this new form of entanglement, it makes it possible to directly test 
        for super-luminal or instant communication between photons without the 
        need for observers (usually named Alice and Bob) to confer by conventional 
        means in order to confirm that information has been passed. More extraordinary 
        still, it implies that retrocausal communication might be possible, to 
        receive a message before it is sent.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Most people would assume that time 
  travel is impossible and science fiction is full of accounts of contradictory 
  plots to demonstrate the point. In Robert Heinlein's 'All You Zombies' with 
  the addition of a sex change the protagonist is both his own father and mother. 
  Curiously however a few physicists take a different view on time travel. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Most physicists reading this maybe 
  sceptical and surprised that any simple low energy experiment could be conceived 
  where the outcome could not be predicted from theory. At the very least Dopfer's 
  discovery appears to have uncovered an incompleteness in quantum mechanics.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Here I consider a special type of 
  time travel: the transmission of information only. There is a theorem that states 
  that there has to be a certain minimum energy associated with a given amount 
  of information and so normally it would be necessary to transport this energy 
  associated with the information as well, but there appears to be a special case 
  where this does not apply. Dopfer's experiment, if confirmed, suggests a way 
  to allow pure information to be transported backwards through time. The further 
  experiments needed to test the idea are relatively easy to perform and there 
  is a possibility that there could be a breakthrough in the near future. Entangled 
  particles form the basis of many experiments, mostly as part of a design for 
  a quantum computer. These entangled states are still quite poorly understood 
  and this idea grows out of a specific experiment carried out to understand them 
  better. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To appreciate how this is possible 
  I will explain a number of important ideas from physics, those familiar with 
  these standard facts please skip ahead to the Dopfer's experiment section. The 
  first is wave particle duality. Light (or indeed all matter if you observe close 
  enough at a microscopic scale) possesses properties of waves and particles. 
  It cannot be both at once since these are fundamentally different but it will 
  show one or other of its characteristics depending on the situation. Generally 
  light behaves like a particle when it is created and again when it is absorbed. 
  While it is moving, it flies like a wave. There is one important exception I 
  will describe.</font></p>

      Fig. 1 Two sources of waves in a ripple tank overlap to create interference 
      patterns. Where the peaks and troughs oppose each other, the waves cancel 
      to produce calm zones. Where the peaks or troughs are in phase, they reinforce 
      to produce stronger waves. </font></td>
    <td width="55%"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Fig. 2 Light from 
      a laser passes through a double slit and produces an interference pattern 
      of light and dark bands. To achieve this each slit has to act as a separate 
      source of light. For sufficiently narrow slits, this is what happens; the 
      light is diffracted as it passes through the slits and does not form a sharp 
      shadow. Instead it spreads out like water waves and interferes with light 
      from the other slit.</font></td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Imagine first some ripples on a pond. 
  (Fig 1) If I start my ripples by disturbing the water at just one point near 
  one side, they would spread as out as semi circles. If I make more waves starting 
  from a place close by to the first source, the waves will spread out from this 
  second point and as the waves cross over each other they make a characteristic 
  pattern called interference. It is a misleading name as they interact in a very 
  orderly way. Visual artists familiar with op art may remember something called 
  the moir&eacute; pattern. If you overlay two parallels sets of lines, or concentric 
  arcs of circles in this case, the lines produce strong fringes where they overlay 
  each other. The waves do the same thing: where two peaks of a wave meet they 
  reinforce, where a peak meets a trough they cancel out. If you do an experiment 
  with light waves which are microscopically small and pass them through two narrow 
  slits, interference patterns form and are visible to the naked eye since they 
  can be much larger than the waves that produced them. It takes a little care 
  to set the experiment up so that the pattern is large enough to see but it is 
  fairly easy using a laser. If we put a screen behind the double slit for the 
  light to fall on, then we would see a series of fringes as shown in fig 2.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So far nothing remarkable has happened. 
  The strange bit comes next. According to one of the theorems of quantum mechanics, 
  Complementarity, we can never simultaneously observe the wave and particle like 
  behaviour of light or any other quanta at the same time. We might ask if the 
  light source is so faint that only one photon at a time is present in the experiment, 
  can a photon interfere with itself? The answer is yes it can. Does that mean 
  it splits into two separate halves to pass through the two slits? Perhaps so, 
  or rather two possible versions of the photon, neither of which definitely exist 
  move along two possible paths, one going through each slit. Exactly how it does 
  this is a great mystery: if you try and watch which slit the photon passes through, 
  it will pass through only one slit and it will no longer interfere. If we keep 
  watching, the photons randomly pass through either slit but we would never see 
  them divide. If we use a time-lapse photo to record the pattern of light and 
  all we would see are two bright zones with no interference as shown in upper 
  right graph of fig. 3. The photons seem to know when they are watched. This 
  'self-consciousness' of the photon is a strange quantum mechanical property 
  and it will be a key feature of the time machine.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What is entanglement? The Uncertainty 
  Principle says that we cannot know everything about a quanta. This is not as 
  a result of any limitations on our behalf to design better instruments, it is 
  because the quanta itself does not have a complete set of properties. This principle 
  operates in a strange and characteristic way. If for example we measure exactly 
  where a quanta is, we can no longer know its momentum. Momentum is the speed 
  measured in a particular direction multiplied by the mass. Alternatively we 
  can measure its momentum exactly only to lose any possibility of measuring its 
  position. A combination of these two properties can be measured but only if 
  we accept some inaccuracy in both measurements. When two entangled quanta share 
  some property that is initially unknown, taking a measurement on one of them 
  will effect what we can know about the entangled partner. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The experiments under discussion 
  all use pairs of infra red quanta created in a lithium iodate crystal that is 
  illuminated by ultra violet light. The process involved, parametric down conversion, 
  is a special form of fluorescence. The pairs of quanta have their momentum entangled.</font></p>

      entanglement. </font></td>

</table>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Looking at this schematic diagram 
  I was initially puzzled. Let me explain what is happening. On the upper left 
  a UV laser is shown simply as a star sending its beam into a crystal shown as 
  a rectangle. A portion of the light is converted into two subsidiary beams. 
  Each time one photon is converted, it is divided into two photons whose total 
  energy and momentum must be exactly equal to the incoming photon. It is this 
  equality of the incoming and outgoing energy and momentum that creates the entanglement. 
  The two photons produced in the crystal are not necessarily identical, but knowing 
  the energy of one, the other then follows by subtraction. There is a whole range 
  of output energies but the experiment chooses to look at almost equal pairs. 
  The number of photon pairs produced is small so that they can be individually 
  registered at the detectors as separate 'clicks'. A coincidence detector senses 
  when two photons arrive at the same time at the two detectors, thereby distinguishing 
  the entangled pairs from any other photons floating around. The light arriving 
  at the upper detector, D2, will be much brighter as there is no double slit 
  in the light path obstructing most of the light as there is in the lower path. 
  Only the coincident pairs of clicks are recorded, all the rest are ignored. 
  </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The hardest bit to comprehend I found 
  was the function of the large lens. The total distance from the lens back to 
  the crystal and then on the lower light path to the double slit is shown as 
  2f, twice the focal length. If we imagine that instead of a crystal, there is 
  a mirror, and that the light in the lower path is travelling towards the mirror, 
  then we can see how the lens can focus an image of the double slit. That is 
  not really happening but the effect of the momentum entanglement will force 
  something similar to that to happen. Every time a photon sets off down the lower 
  path in exactly the right direction to pass through one of the slits, and not 
  get blocked, a companion photon will set off along the upper path in a corresponding 
  direction. This is like quantum billiards. The angles the photons exit the crystal 
  have to correlate precisely. It will not be a literal mirror image but it will 
  form a real image. As a consequence the lens will behave as if it is looking 
  at the double slit when really it is gathering the light of the entangled partner 
  photons. The D2 detector can be moved to the right where the 'image' of the 
  double slits will be sharply focussed or moved to the left where it is completely 
  out of focus. Whether it is in focus or not, the coincidence detector will always 
  determine whether a particular photon passed through the slits so all the corresponding 
  photons can be gathered at the upper detector either with or without knowing 
  which slit they passed through.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Looking at the results shown as graphs 
  of light intensity, the difference between the out of focus and in focus is 
  very strong. Out of focus corresponds to not having any information about which 
  slit the photons passed through and in this situation the photons behave like 
  waves producing an interference pattern. The pattern is clearly visible in both 
  the upper graph of the photons that did not pass through the slits on the upper 
  path of the experiment and the lower graph of the photons that did pass through 
  the slits on the lower path. With the image of slits in focus, the photons behave 
  as particles and two clear peaks corresponding to the two slits show in the 
  upper path data. The detector in the lower path shows only one broad peak since 
  the small lens in the lower path is positioned so that the image of the slits 
  is out of focus. It is there only to gather light.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The raw data coming from the photon 
  detectors were not recorded, only the coincident data. The difference between 
  raw data and coincident data would have been large for the upper D2 detector 
  but rather small for the lower D1 detector. If unprocessed raw data had been 
  recorded for the lower detector, Cramer estimates that around 15 % of the incoming 
  photons would have been regected and the patterns would have been similar showing 
  two distinct states depending on the position of the upper detector. This in 
  itself is a remarkable discovery and needs confirmation.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Next comes the clue to why this experiment 
  might lead to a time machine: the upper arm is longer than the lower arm. The 
  photons have to go further from the source to reach the detector. The difference 
  in length is not great but it is very important because the photons in the short 
  lower path have already arrived at their detector before the photons in the 
  upper arm have reached their detector and yet they still anticipate how that 
  detection is going to be made and behave accordingly. The measurement in the 
  longer path is forcing photons in the shorter arm to change their behaviour 
  even though the upper arm photons are still en route to their detector at the 
  moment the lower arm photons complete their journey.</font></p>

        The graphs on the right show the double slit image in focus in the upper

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The entangled photons from 
        the top arm mysteriously pass a message about how they are being observed

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This experiment confirms definitely 
  that the photons in the two paths are connected in the way they respond to how 
  they are observed; there is no doubt about this connection. A controversy arises 
  over the question of the timing and the assertion that the lower arm anticipates 
  the upper arm. The experiment uses a coincidence detector, an electronic device 
  that registers when photons arrive at both detectors at once. Since one light 
  path is shorter, photons will arrive a few nanoseconds (billionths of a second) 
  earlier on the short path but this small delay will still be recorded as a coincidence. 
  This does not cause any confusion since the number of photons is quite low and 
  it might be a relatively long time; say some 10s or 100s of microseconds before 
  the next pair is recorded. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This experiment was carried out in 
  1998 by Birgit Dopfer at the University of Innsbruck as research for her Ph.D. 
  Her tutor, Anton Zeilinger, is one of the world leaders in experimental quantum 
  optics and is well aware that something interesting has been discovered but 
  specifically denies that the time difference is significant. Has he made a mistake 
  or is there some legitimate reason for ignoring it? This is a very important 
  point so I will criticise in detail what Zeilinger says. </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I 
  quote from a paper published in &quot;Science and Ultimate Reality&quot; a record 
  of the symposium held in honour of John Wheeler's 90th birthday. Zeilinger's 
  paper opens with a description of Wheeler's Delayed Choice Paradox, (see my 
  own page on this), it then moves to consider the Dopfer experiment, pointing 
  out the similarities, to begin:</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;In an experiment a few years 
  ago in my group we brought Wheeler's thought experiment into the laboratory 
  and carried it a step further. The idea was to demonstrate that it can be decided 
  after the photon has been registered already whether the phenomenon observed 
  can be understood as a particle or as a wave.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So far so good, then a little further 
  on he writes:</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Does this now mean that the 
  distribution of the photons in the observation plane behind the two-slit assembly 
  changes depending on what we do with photon 1? Obviously this is impossible, 
  as photon 1 is detected at a time after photon 2 has been registered already.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The key words in the second quote 
  are &quot;obviously this is impossible&quot;. Zeilinger is now contradicting 
  his previously stated description of the experiment: that it is a form of Wheeler's 
  Delayed Choice Paradox. He is assuming that causality must flow in one time 
  direction from past to future. Another mistake follows at once, I continue my 
  quotation exactly from where the last left off:</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The solution is that we have 
  to register the two photons in coincidence. &quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As we have already discussed, the 
  photons cannot arrive in exact coincidence since the path lengths are different, 
  and the coincidence detector measures only that the photons arrive within a 
  short time of each other. Zeilinger seems to have forgotten how his own experimental 
  apparatus works. This is a mistake so trivial and yet so important that it is 
  really extraordinary. Is it possible that I am wrong and Zeilenger is correct? 
  The full technical details of the experiment are in Dopfer's thesis that is 
  in German. I have not read it. It could be correct that the coincidence detector 
  does in fact detect only true coincidence if the individual photon detectors 
  have a slow response time. Perhaps they do not produce a very short click but 
  a longer impulse and that these longer signals do coincide. But even if this 
  is the case, it does not matter, as we know that the photons cannot arrive in 
  synchrony. The details of the detection method are not critical. In quantum 
  mechanics experiments an important distinction has always to be made between 
  the phenomenon under study, that is treated according to quantum mechanics and 
  the measuring apparatus that is treated classically. It is not important exactly 
  how this apparatus in constructed so long as it behaves in a classical, that 
  is to say, precisely predictable way. Exactly how this distinction is made between 
  the phenomenon and the measuring apparatus has been the subject of heated debate 
  but there is no doubt that for all practical purposes the line can be drawn 
  quite clearly as the detector has to amplify what is initially something that 
  is very small, in this case single photons are converted into a flow of many 
  electrons in the detector. The initial point at which the photons are absorbed 
  defines the time and the process of testing for synchronization is a technical 
  matter that cannot influence this initial moment of photon absorption. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Is there anything else that could 
  make Zeilinger's position tenable? Sometimes the Uncertainty Principle allows 
  small differences to be insignificant. Could this be the case here? If the answer 
  were yes we would anticipate that increasing the difference in the arm length 
  would destroy the correlation. The answer is no. The path lengths and consequent 
  time differences are much too large for the uncertainty principle to have anything 
  to do with it. Even though I have not read a full description of the experiment, 
  enough has been published in Zeilinger's paper for me to calculate that the 
  uncertainty limit has been exceeded by a considerable margin. The <a href="DopferUncertainty.htm">full 
  calculation</a> is here.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">One final quote from Zeilinger a 
  little further on in his paper:</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The important conclusion is 
  that, while individual events just happen, their physical interpretation in 
  terms of wave or particle might depend on the future&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Absolutely right, I totally agree 
  but it is not clear how he got this to point after having contradicted this 
  position earlier in his paper, nor do I believe that he really understands the 
  implications of this experiment. I have analysed the situation from the information 
  I have available, further experiments are needed to understand the implications 
  of Dopfer's work.</font> </p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This issue was taken up by Ray Jensen 
  who first communicated privately with John G Cramer. Ray Jensen has subsequently 
  published his own ideas on the Dopfer experiment, and Cramer acknowledges Ray 
  Jensen as the one who proposed the following experiments that Cramer has declared 
  he will try and carry out in collaboration with Warren Nagorney. </font></p>

</table>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> This experiment is very similar 
  to the experiment carried out by Dopfer and easier to understand. Imagine entangled 
  pairs of photons set off down the two different paths. Along each route, the 
  light beams will pass through a double slit and then after that they will go 
  to some measuring apparatus. There are two routes, each with their own identical 
  double slit. We have to set up the experiment precisely so that when a single 
  photon passes through one of the slits, its entangled partner will be passing 
  through the corresponding slit in the other path. Everything described so far 
  will be exactly the same for each of the two paths; the routes are only different 
  when it comes to the measuring apparatus. Along the upper route we provide a 
  way to observe which of the double slits the individual photons pass through. 
  On the lower route, we simply gather the light without checking which of the 
  slits it passed through. As before the design allows us to choose whether we 
  see which way the light passed through the slits with a lens. If it focuses 
  the image of the slits, we see which way the light came, if it is out of focus, 
  we still measure the photons arriving, but no longer know which slit they come 
  through as the image is now blurred. In focus we see the two slits, out of focus, 
  the blurry but recognizable interference pattern will show. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The prediction is that on the lower 
  path, the entangled sister photons respond to what is happening in the upper 
  path and behave in the same way exactly as they did in the Dopfer experiment. 
  If the light in the upper path is being sharply focussed, there will be no fringes 
  visible in the lower path either. If the light in the upper path is out of focus 
  and fringes are present, then the fringes show in the lower path too. The entangled 
  photons have to have the same properties. The entangled pairs will either both 
  behave like particles or both behave like waves. This experiment is not the 
  same as the Dopfer experiment because there are now two double slits. This means 
  we no longer need to use the coincidence detector as the stray light present 
  in the Dopfer experiment will not be a problem here.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Removing the coincidence detector 
  is the crucial difference from the Dopfer experiment because now we can have 
  two separate experimenters working independently, call them Alice and Bob. Alice 
  operates only the upper light path and Bob the lower light path. They each independently 
  collect data, and lets say there is a partition set up so that they cannot see 
  each other work and they agree not to talk during the tests. Alice has the additional 
  freedom to move her detector and Bob can determine where she has moved her detector 
  from the pattern of light he collects. He can predict her moves but is not receiving 
  a conventional message. No energy passes from Alice's side of the the experiment 
  to Bob. This is communication through entanglement. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">John G Cramer's has stated that he 
  intends to repeat Dopfer's experiment, then carry out the experiment I described 
  under the heading 'Towards a Time Machine' and if those both work according 
  to prediction, move to an experiment where he extends the length of the upper 
  arm by 10 kilometres using a pair of fibre optic cables as shown in the figure 
  above. They can be kept spooled up so all the equipment will sit happily in 
  one lab. The fibre optics will be arranged with one fibre behind each of the 
  double slits. The photons will either travel down one or other fibre, if they 
  are being watched, or they will divide and travel along both at once if we do 
  not observe which way the light travels. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">With 10 kilometres of fibre optic, 
  the inverted delay predicted is 50 microseconds. It does not sound like much 
  but it will be an extraordinary achievement if the experiment works. Until now 
  the time differences involved have been very small and so far ignored. This 
  still seems like a very short time but it is 10,000 times longer than observed 
  before. To prove that this inverted delay is really occurring, a further experiment 
  is needed that has not yet been designed. I give an outline of how this might 
  be done in <a href="time_gate.htm">Time Gate</a> and then go onto show how a 
  positive result on this further experiment will open the gateway to building 
  a time machine for information. </font></p>

  or particles. This clearly is not practical because I would have to have a telescope 
  so good that I could detect which slit the photons emerged from back on Earth. 
  Difficult but no matter, this is a thought experiment, and possible in theory. 
  I can now use this set up to send my report using Morse code or any digital 
  code I care to choose. The light that I am receiving has taken about 4 hours 
  to make it out to Pluto. We predict that in the lab the light on the short path 
  just crossing between bits of apparatus will anticipate my message and receive 
  it 4 hours before I send it! That sounds crazy but that is time travel.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Lets step through the argument again 
  and show whether it looks right or whether there might be a mistake. Conventional 
  entanglement involves a conserved property like spin or momentum. When quanta 
  are entangled by one of these methods the total amount of the conserved property 
  is precisely known but distributed indeterminately. Neither quanta individually 
  have any particular share of the property until one of the particles is measured, 
  the other quanta's property then becomes definite too. In this experiment we 
  start out with pairs of momentum entangled photons. After passing through the 
  double slits they lose their momentum entanglement as they are now free to travel 
  in a variety of directions allowed by diffraction with the slits. They still 
  have a form on entanglement I will call Observer entanglement that will preserve 
  Complementarity. Recall that complementarily says that a quanta cannot show 
  both its wave and particle like behaviour at once. (In fact it can show a mixture 
  of properties but only by introducing a further level of uncertainty in the 
  nature of that mixture.)</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Complementarily cannot act in such 
  a straight forward way between individual pairs of quanta as individual quanta 
  being registered will always make a single click at a single place. Their wavelike 
  or particle behaviour is only revealed by observing a statistically significant 
  number of quanta whose average properties will be wavelike or not, that is to 
  say, show an interference pattern. Cramer's prediction is that the Observer 
  entanglement is still shared between individual pairs of quanta even though 
  it reveals itself only on an aggregate. If he is correct, then an individual 
  quanta arriving at Pluto will force its partner to behave according to how it 
  is going to be detected, and adopt the statistics of wavelike or particle behavior. 
  Its partner however sets out on its brief journey 4 hours earlier and arrives 
  a moment later at another part of the Earth bound lab. It is for this reason 
  that the inverted delay should occur. Cramer has analyzed these experiments 
  using Transactional Interpretation, his version of quantum mechanics. As far 
  as I can determine a conventional analysis would come to the same conclusion, 
  but this is tentative, let us consider some other options. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Observer entanglement may simply 
  disappear when one arm is sufficiently extended but the question then will be 
  how far can one arm be extended before it disappears and what is the mechanism 
  that makes it disappear? This is not a straight forward proposal as we would 
  have to modify quantum mechanics. Srikanth has studied this problem in detail. 
  There is no obvious way to explain the disappearance of Observer entanglement. 
  Having once discovered the beast, it is hard to make it go away. Another option 
  is that Observer entanglement is maintained but the information is not communicated 
  between individual pairs of photons. The change in behaviour observed back on 
  Earth might for example occur simultaneously with the change in observation 
  technique on Pluto. This sounds reasonable but is in conflict with special relativity. 
  It would imply that there is a universal time. Another option again is that 
  the change observed would arrive after the change made on Pluto. Perhaps the 
  information travels back to Earth at the speed of light and the message is received 
  at exactly the same time as if it had been sent by a conventional means. That 
  is what Einstein would have liked, but years of study of other forms of entanglement 
  have never revealed anything of the sort going on. Quite the contrary, there 
  is strong evidence the violation of the Bell inequality occurs between individual 
  pairs of photons exactly as we first discussed. All these other options introduce 
  further complications, the prediction that retrocausality should occur comes 
  closest to preserving the known laws of physics. With Transactional Interpretation 
  (see <a href="cramer_ti.htm">Cramer</a>) even special relativity is preserved 
  as all the interactions occur within the past and future light cones of the 
  events in question, information moves backwards and forwards through time at 
  the normal speed of light.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A final point to note is that if 
  I had set up a space station midway between Earth and Pluto and arranged for 
  it to be transmitting two entangled beams of photons, one directed back to Earth 
  another out to me on Pluto, I could instantly communicate because now we could 
  establish a correlation between to equal length light paths. This is another 
  consequence of Observer entanglement which is very important in its own right. 
  All previous experiments with sensing entanglement at remote locations showed 
  that although the quantas properties were correlated, no information could be 
  sent, as the correlation only showed random changes from quantum uncertainty. 
  The implication of Dopfer's experiment, if confirmed, are very profound. They 
  will force us to re-evaluate our understanding of special relativity which is 
  currently believed to set a strict speed limit on all communication. This shows 
  that pure information can be transmitted faster than light, and it does so without 
  violating special relativity.</font></p>

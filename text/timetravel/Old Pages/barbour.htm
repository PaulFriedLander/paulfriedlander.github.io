<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Julian Barbour's view is that time 
  does not exist. How then are we to account for impression that time exists and 
  all the wealth of evidence to support that impression? His proposal is that 
  we should consider the universe to be formed of a vast collection of something 
  like snapshots, fully three dimensional but with no movement. Each snapshot 
  is not literally a recording onto a media, it is in itself the nature of that 
  moment, that 'Now' as he would call it. The snapshots are mathematical structures 
  he describes as Platonic forms. He proposes that these snapshots of reality 
  co-exist in a higher dimensional realm: eternal and unchanging, each a single 
  possible state of the universe. Barbour writes: &quot;I am getting ever more 
  Platonic (or Pythagorean) and am prepared to identify the physical world with 
  the realm of ideals.&quot; When first trying to grasp his idea, one might expect 
  these snapshots to be organised like frames on a movie film, but their relationship 
  is more complex. There is no single order in which they can be placed, this 
  is a form of Many Worlds cosmology. Barbour describes a range of increasingly 
  subtle ways to order the snapshots starting with the simple distinction that 
  follows from the expansion of the universe, we will find a variation of the 
  density of matter, next we can look for the distribution of matter and how it 
  locally curves space-time. Where two snapshots closely resemble each other, 
  but differ in someway, we can consider these to be equivalent to consecutive 
  moments in time. Finally we can look into the detail of the matter where we 
  will sometimes find signs that one snapshot precedes another. In any snapshot 
  that contains our Earth for example, its rich texture shows its history. These 
  ordering processes give a structure resembling time yet still are not. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Barbour's ideas were in part inspired 
  from the Wheeler DeWitt equation, an early attempt to formulate quantum gravity 
  that produced an equation of state for the universe with no time variable. This 
  equation specifies a wave function for the universe and sets it constant. Most 
  physicists dismiss it as a mistake, citing the obvious reason that the universe 
  does change over time, it expands, and so its wave function must change too. 
  Others raise a more subtle objection to the equation arguing that it is impossible 
  in principle to construct a wave function for the entire universe as quantum 
  mechanics is an inherently dualistic theory separating the subject matter under 
  observation and the measuring instruments used to make the observation. With 
  the whole universe under study, the observer would need to be outside the universe 
  to make an observation. This might sound like splitting hairs but it is not. 
  The measuring instruments are always treated in a different way, they are considered 
  to be classical objects that have definite states with no uncertainty, where 
  as a state defined by a wave function intrinsically has uncertainty. Normally 
  the measurements are being made on incredibly small things, quanta, and the 
  problem does not arise. It only becomes apparent when quantum mechanics is stretched 
  to the largest scale. There are other other cosmologist who accept the Wheeler 
  DeWitt equation but they do not agree that time does not exist at all. It can 
  be argued that the universe tunneled out of some other time independent state 
  of being. Like all explanations for the Big Bang, this is speculation. Barbour 
  clearly defends his provocative position brilliantly as his ideas have gained 
  him great respect, he is very frequently cited and has inspired others. Lee 
  Smolin, one of the fiercest critics of the state of physics today does not agree 
  with Barbour about the non existence of time but considers him as being a philosophical 
  mentor. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Barbour's radical position does not 
  automatically make time travel possible. He considers time travel unlikely, 
  but as Einstein found , ideas may have implications that their creators do not 
  wish to consider. Powerful ideas live a life of their own. Barbour's ideas are 
  certainly powerful and his theory may prove relevant.</font></p>

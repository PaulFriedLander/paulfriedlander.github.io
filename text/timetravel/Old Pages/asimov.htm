<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The concept of a cascade of small 
  backward intervals of time was first explored by Isaac Asimov in &quot;The Endochronic 
  Properties of Resublimated Thiotimoline,&quot; published in the March 1948 issue 
  of Astounding Science Fiction and reprinted in The Analog Anthology #1 (Davis, 
  1980). This was a spoof scientific article. The article presents the description 
  of fictitious substance thiotimoline. Thiotimoline has the property that it 
  dissolves 1.12 seconds before the introduction of a solvent. Asimov further 
  discusses telechronic batteries. These use a series of cells containing thiotimoline 
  connected to each other through a process of adding water to extend the inverted 
  delay time over which the thiotimoline will dissolve. I quote: </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">'The principle behind the telechronic 
  battery is easy to understand and home experimenters will have no trouble constructing 
  their own. A test tube containing properly purified thiotimoline is placed between 
  a low-powered laser and a photoelectric cell. When the thiotimoline dissolves, 
  1.12 seconds before the addition of water, the formerly opaque thiotimoline 
  becomes transparent and the photoelectric cell is tripped. This in turn results 
  in water being added to another test tube containing thiotimoline. The thiotimoline 
  in the second test tube will, of course, dissolve 2.24 seconds before water 
  was added to the first tube. By cascading these &quot;endochronometers&quot; 
  it is possible to create a telechronic battery of any desired time constant. 
  Cascading 3215 endochronometers, for example, results in a battery in which 
  the last tube's thiotimoline dissolves about 1 hour before water is added to 
  the first tube.' </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">A few days after reading 
  the New Scientist article where I first learnt about John Cramer's ideas I suddenly 
  realised that a retro causal effect over any time length, however short, could 
  be amplified by cascading a series of these short 'inverted delays'. In a great 
  state of excitement I wrote to Cramer; his response was that I was correct but 
  Asimov had anticiapted my idea by almost 60 years. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+4">The Time Gate</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If Cramer's experiments as described 
  previously succeed, this proves that there is a 'spooky action at a distance' 
  associated with the observer entanglement but it will not measure the exact 
  timing of this change in the light pattern caused by observer entanglement. 
  To do that the experiment will have to be redesigned once more. The moveable 
  detector in the upper light path will have to be replaced by something faster. 
  Only when the changes measured in the two light paths can be timed exactly to 
  within microseconds will we know for sure whether retrocausality is occurring 
  and whether a Time Gate, as I will call it, has been built. A time gate I am 
  defining as any practical device that can send information backwards through 
  time. According to Cramer's own calculation a 10 km path difference produced 
  by extending one path with a pair of fibre optic cables will create a 50 microsecond 
  inverted delay. If his argument concerning information being transmitted between 
  the individual entangled pairs of photons is correct, then that is exactly what 
  will be observed. 50 microseconds does not sound like much of an inverted delay, 
  but it is enough to build a time gate as I am about to show.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The fictitious telechronic batteries 
  described in the <a href="asimov.htm">Asimov</a> page were limited in the range 
  they could send an effect back through time by the number of cells. The information 
  they sent was only a single bit, either they have or have not been exposed to 
  solvent at a later point in time. In the real world things will not be so limited. 
  Even a 50 microsecond inverted delay, with appropriate instrumentation becomes 
  a very powerful discovery:</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><u>Given that it should be possible 
  to receive a packet of information before it is sent, we can choose to re-send 
  that same package back through time again and again. By re-sending the information 
  many times it can be sent back indefinitely. The information can never be sent 
  back to an earlier time than when the experiment first becomes fully operational 
  but having once opened the 'Time Gate', there is no limit in principle to how 
  far in the future information may come back to us from.</u></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Anyone wanting to know how big a 
  packet of information will be will realise that this correlates with how fast 
  the light pattern can be modulated, and how quickly these modulations detected. 
  This in turn will depend on quite a number of experimental factors. I will not 
  go into this because this is all engineering (Although I have certainly given 
  this subject consideration.) I am concerned here with the test and proof of 
  a principle. If it works at all, we can be sure that people will soon improve 
  the technique to the point where it works well enough that this packet can contain 
  a useful amount of information. (And heck, next weeks lottery numbers is not 
  a lot of information but it would be very useful knowing it a week before anyone 
  else.) </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The proof that the retrocausal transmission 
  of information is possible leads to an entirely new world but it will take a 
  lot to convince most physicists and probably at least one other group of researchers 
  will have to repeat the experiment before it will be taken seriously. The current 
  culture in physics is surprisingly conservative, there are only a very few researchers 
  who would risk their time and reputation on this venture. This problem of the 
  culture of physics is discussed by Lee Smolin in 'The Trouble with Physics'. 
  Lee was kind enough to send a lengthy reply to my inquiries but did not directly 
  discuss some of my questions. I realise that these are deep points and that 
  it would be hasty to judge them, but I am aware that even Lee was cautious. 
  I hope that he is giving careful consideration and will respond when the time 
  is ripe. The consensus is that we already know all the important ideas at the 
  low energy levels associated with this kind of experiment. The first shake up 
  would come for physicists having to admit that retrocausality is even hypothetically 
  possible. There is also a very important principle under investigation: Causality. 
  It is generally believed that any form of time machine will lead to logical 
  contradictions. Causality prevents this by always requiring that a cause must 
  precede an effect. Where physical theory or experiment lead to a prediction 
  that runs counter to causality, there is a very strong expectation that there 
  is a mistake. Causality is fundamental and cannot be violated without a breakdown 
  in the orderly understanding of reality. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The assumption of the conventional 
  point of view that time and causation are inextricably linked is not entirely 
  supported by the already known laws of physics. There are a number of different 
  ways to define time. At a microscopic level of interactions between individual 
  particles, it is impossible to distinguish past from future. The problem of 
  the 'arrow of time' as it is known has long been discussed. The widely accepted 
  conclusion is that the direction time flows can most meaningfully defined at 
  a scale much large than individual quantum interactions and on this larger scale 
  entropy enforces increasing levels of disorder with the passage of time. There 
  is no avoiding entropy, it can never decrease but there are two problems with 
  this approach, first that physics has to account for the extraordinarily low 
  level of disorder at the moment of creation and second since this direction 
  of time does not apply to individual interactions, it leaves a loop hole for 
  supporters of time travel to question its authority. Any process that does not 
  involve the degradation of energy to lower forms might in principle be time 
  reversible. Only increases in entropy prevents time reversal. Observer entanglement 
  involves a transmission of information without energy transfer, and by implication 
  there will be no entropy increase associated with this form of interaction.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Ludwig Boltzmann back at the end 
  of the 19th century developed the idea that the arrow of time can best be understood 
  in relation to entropy but his arguments did not persuade physicists then because 
  the universe was thought to be eternal and should have undergone 'heat death', 
  everything should have become equally luke warm, in a state of thermal equilibrium. 
  Boltzmann showed how arbitrarily large fluctuations from equilibrium were theoretically 
  possible but others were not impressed. Today Bolzmann's idea is accepted as 
  correct and the low level of disorder is considered to be a product of inflation. 
  I remain unhappy with the Big Bang. Inflation has greatly improved its explanatory 
  powers for times after the moment of creation, but the moment itself remains 
  a complete mystery. Various theories concerning colliding branes and oscillatory 
  universes have been mooted in recent years but none appears to be likely. The 
  most interesting idea that goes beyond the Big Bang I have found is Lee Smolin's 
  concept for evolving universes. The subject of how to define time was taken 
  up again by Roger Penrose investigating conditions inside a black hole. It is 
  known that as you approach the central singularity, space-time will be increasingly 
  distorted and finally destroyed. He invented spin networks in 1971 to show how 
  something resembling space-time can be built from simpler elements. This subject 
  continues to be a investigated by Lee Smolin, Fotini Markopoulou and others.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">More recently non temporal causality 
  has directly come under study. It began with a mathematical structure called 
  the Causal set first described by Bobelli and others in 1987 and developed by 
  Sorkin in 1990. A causal set has members p, q, r... These members can then be 
  ordered according to rules: p less than or equal to q, etc. The lowest order 
  can be identified with the earliest point in time. From this simple beginning 
  complex mathematical structures quickly grow. This is relevant to cosmologists 
  trying to understand the Planck time, the era that lasts just 10 to the minus 
  35 of a second at the beginning of the universe during which none of the existing 
  measures of time can be used. Space-time is scrambled into a foam and no known 
  physical processes would exist. The approach adopted by most physicists is to 
  reconstruct something that resembles conventional time, referred to as globally 
  hyperbolic, however it does not have to be as simple as that, the mathematics 
  allows for other possibilities. Computer theoreticians are exploring options 
  with multi path time. These mathematical structures could form the basis for 
  future quantum computer architecture. They may also be a description of an interconnected 
  Many Worlds reality. I do not know, because I have not researched further but 
  I suspect that there are ideas in Emergence and Complexity theory and the study 
  of networks that are also consistent with a complex structure to time. Most 
  physicists have been cautious to explore non globally hyperbolic theories; there 
  is an expectation these theories lead to the breakdown of all order but I suspect 
  this will be shown to be simplistic, rather they lead to the appearance of new 
  and more richly structured orders.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Understanding time in a universe 
  where information can flow in both directions will be hard. Neither Cramer's 
  TI or the original Many Worlds as envisaged by Everett will be sufficient I 
  suspect. A younger generation of scientists will take up these problems. Finally, 
  if time travel is possible, the answers will come back to us from the future. 
  The challenge will be to understand these new ideas.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="7">Is Time Travel Possible?</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">My interest in the subject of time 
  travel was triggered by reading an article in 28 September 2006 New Scientist 
  claiming that not only might time travel be possible but that experiments within 
  the near future could confirm this. The physicist making this claim, John G 
  Cramer, is already well known for producing his own interpretation of quantum 
  mechanics. I was intrigued and became very excited by this possibility. This 
  is certainly not the first time that serious scientists have discussed time 
  travel but it is I believe the first time their ideas went beyond thought experiments 
  with little or no hope of being tested. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This idea comes directly from experiment. 
  An interesting discovery that has been talked about but its implications not 
  yet explored. Those implications are so surprising that most physicists appear 
  to have been avoiding them. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I have organised the time travel 
  section of my website into a number of pages. In <a href="experiment.htm">Experiment</a> 
  I explain how nano-interval time travel may already have been created by accident 
  and I describe John G Cramer's proposals. I analyse them and agree that they 
  do really offer a way to transmit information instantly or back through time.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the brief pages following I contextualize 
  the subject showing how developments in physics have been leading in the direction 
  of time travel for a 100 years. The clues are all there in the subject. The 
  relevance of the one science fiction page, <a href="asimov.htm">Asimov</a>, 
  will become apparent in the following section, <a href="time_gate.htm">Time 
  Gate</a>, where I discuss what happens if Cramer's proposed experiments succeed 
  and what happens next.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Finally in <a href="implications.htm">Implications</a> 
  I explore the consequences of this discovery for the whole of society. Time 
  travel, if it is coming, is going to change the World far more than we can possibly 
  imagine at this moment. </font></p>

  comments and criticisms are most welcome. email <a href="mailto:pzf@paulfriedlander.com">Paul

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="+4">Many Worlds</font></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Many Worlds is an idea introduced 
  by Hugh Everett as an interpretation of quantum mechanics. He proposed it as 
  a way to make quantum mechanics deterministic. He showed that when the equations 
  show that several different events are possible, it could be argued that all 
  the possibilities happen, each in their own separate universe. This interpretation 
  would preserve the unitary development of the wave function in a smooth and 
  continuous way so that quantum mechanics does not imply random processes are 
  fundamental. What remains as random is which particular branch of the universe 
  we happen to find ourselves in. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The branching appears to lead to 
  an exponential number of new universes continuously being created, including 
  multiple copies of myself all writing slightly different versions of this article. 
  Max Tegmark dismisses this criticism. He argues that the number of universes 
  is finite and that the parallel worlds are mostly very similar and frequently 
  merge as well. He considers the number of universes not a problem at all. Viewed 
  from a timeless point of view, as Barbour would, all possible configurations 
  of the universe exist eternally so there is no growth at all. David Deutsch, 
  who pionered much of the early theoretical research in quantum computing, is 
  also a strong supporter of Many Worlds. He argues that the development of quantum 
  computers is evidence in its favour as the power of the qubit depends upon its 
  ability to interact with itself in those other universes.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> I would suggest that Many Worlds 
  is necessary for time travel and that you cannot have one without the other. 
  The alternative is that if the Many Worlds do not exist and time travel is possible, 
  the Universe must be perfectly deterministic and we do not have free will. The 
  existence of free will most people take as fundamental, although no surprise 
  to find that some physicists would disagree.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I conjecture that Many Worlds will 
  act as a filter blocking certain types of information from being sent back from 
  the future. We would receive messages from numerous different versions of the 
  future and any variations that are random, perhaps for example the future state 
  of the stock market as described in Implications, would become blurred by the 
  overlapping of the different messages. Our instruments would produce ambiguous 
  readings when we tried to receive any purely stochastic information. In contrast 
  a process that is presently beyond human understanding but for which there is 
  almost certainly is a perfectly good deterministic theory, say being able to 
  predict earthquakes, the warning should come through very clearly as in any 
  version of the World that is substantially similar to this one, earthquakes 
  will still happen at the same moments. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Let us now consider another kind 
  of information arriving from the future: science and technology. Unlike the 
  stock prices this will remain accurate even after the information is freely 
  and openly available. We can imagine that in this situation, many workers will 
  seek to reproduce methods and results already known about in the future. This 
  introduces us to the yet another variant on the familiar paradoxes of time travel. 
  Is this the show stopper or can we still push ahead with this line of reasoning? 
  Who, it will be asked, originated an idea if the first to work on it learnt 
  about the concept in papers not yet published. Will they find their own names 
  on those papers or other? It looks like cheating. It must be admitted that there 
  are far more unanswered questions at this point than clear answers. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I am predicting that the presence 
  of many worlds will be a key factor in determining what information we can receive 
  and what gets scrambled in its journey from the future. Whether this involves 
  cheating or not in the way I have just described, I am not sure. As an artist 
  I have always had the intuition that I am already in contact with the future. 
  My suspicion is that receiving information from the future is one of the senses 
  of the unconscious mind. Most people do not notice if it happens or do not have 
  the gift, but precognition, in one form or another is widely recognised outside 
  the world of hard science. For many ideas come in dreams but it can happen just 
  easily when we are wide awake. I would not pretend to be able to will this sense 
  or direct it in any way yet I feel convinced that it has been a channel for 
  inspiration, and on at least one occasion for more direct information too.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="7">Is Time Travel Possible?</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">My interest in the subject of time 
  travel was triggered by reading an article in 28 September 2006 New Scientist 
  claiming that not only might time travel be possible but that experiments within 
  the near future could confirm this. The physicist making this claim, John G 
  Cramer, is already well known for producing his own interpretation of quantum 
  mechanics. I was intrigued and became very excited by this possibility. This 
  is certainly not the first time that serious scientists have discussed time 
  travel but it is I believe the first time their ideas went beyond thought experiments 
  with little or no hope of being tested. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Initially I had high hopes that Cramer 
  might actually be right, and this section of my website was written while excited 
  about this possibility. Looking back I remain interested but more level headed. 
  Cramer's approach no longer looks hopeful but I have a continuing interest in 
  the idea. While these pages were written in the few months after first learning 
  of this proposal, today I continue to think about the subject and have formulated 
  my own as yet unpublished ideas. Perhaps I will have more to say about this 
  again at some point.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I have organised this section of 
  my website as follows. In <a href="experiment.htm">Experiment</a> I explain 
  how nano-interval time travel may already have been created by accident and 
  I describe John G Cramer's proposals. </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 
  the brief pages following I contextualize the subject showing how developments 
  in physics have been leading in the direction of time travel for a 100 years. 
  The clues are there in the subject. The relevance of the one science fiction 
  page, <a href="asimov.htm">Asimov</a>, will become apparent in the following 
  section, <a href="time_gate.htm">Time Gate</a>, where I discuss what happens 
  if the proposed experiments succeed and how to build a device for transmitting 
  information backwards through time. I consider the paradox of time travel in 
  <a href="theory.htm">Theory</a>. </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><a href="implications.htm">Implications</a> 
  explores the consequences of this discovery for the whole of society. This page 
  along with the final page, Omnipresence, still in preparation, is written from 
  a much more speculative point of view. There are many mistakes. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I would encourage feedback, intelligent 
  comments and criticisms are most welcome. email <a href="mailto:pzf@paulfriedlander.com">Paul 
  Friedlander</a></font></p>

  were kind enough to reply to my inquiries on this and other related subjects 
  on the foundations of physics: Julian Barbour, Brandon Carter, John Cramer,

  Pressburger and Lee Smolin.</font></p>

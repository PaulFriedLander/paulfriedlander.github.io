<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+4">Richard Feynman on Time</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Undoubtedly one of the most influential 
  physicists of the 20th century, arguably standing second in line after Einstein, 
  Feynman introduced the idea that we treat antimatter as matter travelling backwards 
  in time. It is one of the key ideas that he used in developing the Feynman Diagrams 
  that provide the basic tool with which almost all particle physicists have worked 
  with ever since. His own view on quantum mechanics was that we should treat 
  particles and photons as capable of doing anything, indeed that they did everything 
  and they travelled on all possible paths open to them, multiple copies of each 
  fundamental particle simultaneously buzzing out in all kinds or crazy ways. 
  Light travelling in curved or twisted routes, even moving backwards in time. 
  You then sum all these possible histories together, the math shows that most 
  of them cancel out and out pops the consistent paths. This is not just a wild 
  idea; he showed this is a good way of predicting how experiments will behave. 
  It solves for example the double slit problem of how one photon can go through 
  two slits.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">By a logical extension of Feynman's 
  consistent paths, the same rules can be applied to calculating what can or cannot 
  be done in time travel. Nick Herbert wrote in a personal communication: 'Killing 
  your grandmother before your mother was born would create an inconsistent history 
  so is forbidden. What you would experience if you tried to kill your grandmother 
  would be strange quantum forces that magically prevent this action from happening 
  no matter how hard you tried. These quantum forces would be similar to the Pauli 
  Exclusion Principle for the electrons that hold matter together. The Temporal 
  Consistency Principle is a kind of Pauli Principle acting through time rather 
  than space.'</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If we were able to ask Feynman what 
  he thought about time travel, he would not necessarily be a strong advocate. 
  Despite his colourful personal style, he was a very careful physicist and although 
  his idea sometimes sounded wild, they were very carefully reasoned. The idea 
  of antimatter being ordinary matter travelling backwards through time does not 
  in itself provide a way to build a time machine, even hypothetically. He would 
  have wanted to see the time machine idea worked out in detail before he was 
  convinced. Paul Davies has also discussed using the concept of consistent paths 
  as a way of understanding time travel but his arguments are no more water tight 
  that Herbert's example. We are left with a sense that something is missing, 
  no realistic physical process is proposed that can prevent contradiction. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+4">Wheeler's Delayed Choice 
  Paradox</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The physicist John Wheeler thought 
  about the double slit experiment and asked himself: what would happen if we 
  did not decide whether to check which way the photons went until after they 
  had passed the slit, would they still respond so as to show only their particle 
  or wave identity but never both at once? In a lab light moves so quickly it 
  is hard to delay the decision on how we are to measure it, but supposing that 
  we used a light source that was a distant quasar, billions of light years away. 
  The light could have been travelling towards us for longer than the World exists 
  and yet apparently it still does not decide whether to behave like a wave or 
  a particle until it encounters some measuring apparatus. This experiment, although 
  it is probably impossible to carry out does not sound to physicists as impossible 
  as you might imagine. Some objects in the universe bend light, indeed any large 
  mass will. There are quasars known that lie directly behind other galaxies so 
  that their image is distorted and magnified by passing a nearer galaxy on the 
  way to our telescopes. We would have to find a quasar where there were just 
  two paths around the intervening lensing object. The observer can adjust the 
  relative path length to get the light in phase by delaying the light arriving 
  along the shorter path by passing it through a suitable fibre optic. In practice 
  this might be very difficult since the two paths might differ in length by light 
  years but no matter. This is a thought experiment. It is hard to perform but 
  perfectly logical. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Wheeler's delayed choice paradox 
  has been with us for since 1978. Th first partial confirmation was carried out 
  by Carroll Alley in 1986. Others have carried out increasingly sophisticated 
  tests since. The most recent I have found carried out by Scully and others in 
  2001 again confirms that the light really does not 'decide' how it is going 
  to travel until it gets there. As before this was a laboratory setup. It did 
  not involve starlight and the time period is only nanoseconds for the light 
  to pass through the apparatus. A short time but significant because the effect 
  precedes the cause. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Wheeler's paradox is the first clear 
  sign that retrocausal connections may exist. The experiments to test the delayed 
  choice paradox are similar to Dopfer's experiment, which is another experiment 
  in the same class. One might wonder why Wheeler missed this step and did not 
  predict retro causal communication. He believed in it what he called the participatory 
  universe, a universe that only comes into existence as we observe it. This idea 
  arises from his interpretation of quantum mechanics and gave him an alternative 
  understanding of his paradox.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+4">Einstein's View </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Einstein was deeply troubled by the 
  problem of time. In the Newtonian World with universal time and space, the present 
  moment was unique and unambiguous. Only the present really existed, the past 
  was done and the future yet to come. With the advent of Special Relativity this 
  all changed, the present moment was defined differently for each frame of reference. 
  If I pace up and down while I am thinking about this, I am changing my position 
  and velocity and hence my frame of reference. In a galaxy far far away, my estimate 
  of what day today is for the citizens of that far off place will be wobbling 
  around by more than a 100 years as I change the direction I walk in. The bigger 
  the distances involved and the bigger the velocity change the more marked these 
  effects become. It only makes sense if we acknowledge that the whole of space-time 
  all coexists, but then how are we to understand the special quality of the moment 
  we call now? Our common sense tells us that now is the only time that really 
  exists but that it is not so. We cannot even define it unambiguously.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Einstein passionately believed in 
  causality, the strict temporal ordering of events. The structure of special 
  relativity appears to enforce causality. The mathematical formalism prevents 
  matter and energy from accelerating to speeds faster than light, a necessary 
  corollary, since anything going faster than light can also travel backwards 
  in time. What he missed was that there might be a way to transmit pure information, 
  unconnected with mass or energy.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The situation with General Relativity 
  (GR) is far more complex because of the richness of the theorem. Einstein was 
  disturbed to find that it implied many things that he had not anticipated. Shortly 
  after publishing GR, the Russian physicist Friedmann showed that it implies 
  that the universe is unstable, either expanding or contracting, and therefore 
  that time must either have a beginning or an end. The Big Bang and the expanding 
  universe were unknown at the time. In the former way of thinking it was presumed 
  that the universe and time were eternal. This discovery was a terrible shock 
  to Einstein who tried to get this result suppressed. Afterwards he apologised 
  to Friedmann but it was to be the beginning of a rocky road for Einstein who 
  never fully accepted many of the discoveries other scientists made. He was the 
  most revolutionary of them all and yet lived in great doubt as to where scientific 
  knowledge was going.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And here is something else to think 
  about next time you are watching the stars: for starlight, time does not exist 
  at all. From the frame of reference of the starlight, it leaves its distant 
  star and arrives here all in the same instant. Einstein always claimed that 
  it was thinking about what it would be like to ride along with a beam of light 
  that was his inspiration for special relativity. </font></p>

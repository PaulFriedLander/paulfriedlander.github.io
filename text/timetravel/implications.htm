<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+4">A World With Time Travel</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Here I speculate about what will 
  hapen if time travel is possible. The really important consequences of the discovery 
  of a method to receive information from the future for society as a whole are 
  far greater than any former scientific discovery and almost impossible to anticipate. 
  Some may view this as a threat, others as a new age. Whatever each individuals 
  view, society as a whole will respond and this may prove another key factor 
  in developments. It is my judgment that the technical difficulties in transforming 
  an initial experiment into a mature time technology will be substantial but 
  quickly surmounted. If sufficient effort is brought to bear I anticipate that 
  Time Gate technology would be developed within a matter of years. If for example 
  the proof of principle were reached this year, 2007, then by about 2012, the 
  consequences would begin to be felt. What do I have in mind? Well here is just 
  one possibility:</font></p>
<table width="80%" border="2">
  <tr> 
    <td> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Secret Time Gate</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Let us imagine a small group 
        of physicists decide to develop the Time Gate purely for their self-interest. 
        We are all familiar with the short term volatility of the stock market 
        so as soon as the experiment is working well enough that it can send back 
        in time a reasonably large list of stock prices of over no more than a 
        few minutes, the project can begin in earnest. Using seed money from their 
        own small savings they put themselves into a position of unstoppable advantage. 
        We can assume these are very smart guys and they soon figure out how to 
        automate the whole process so that a computer compares current prices 
        with upcoming prices and then makes all the appropriate trades constantly 
        changing their portfolio in anticipation of each change. They can be assured 
        of frequent gains, almost no losses and gains coming almost every few 
        minutes. Whilst their portfolio remains small, their presence will go 
        unnoticed but it is the nature of exponential growth that it cannot remain 
        like that for long. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Since they are a very smart 
        bunch of guys they can predict ahead using other means than the Time Gate 
        to give themselves some approximate idea of what will happen further off 
        in the future. By an adaptation of perturbation theory to this special 
        case, they will be able to anticipate when their presence would be felt. 
        This would happen when they become very major traders. Before the market 
        became aware that some major new force is eating up shares unstoppably, 
        their ability to anticipate a possible chaotic change or collapse in share 
        prices will allow them to shift strategy. By this point they might well 
        be the world's largest stockholders. This should give them more than ample 
        choice of where they want to go next.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Whilst only a single group of researchers 
  secretly use their knowledge of the future for personal gain, their position 
  appears strong but in reality is fragile and short lived. The kind of information 
  they depend on might only remain reliable so long as their activity goes undetected. 
  The moment this changes, all hell breaks loose. The markets would close; the 
  world would panic. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The end of the age of capitalism 
  might just be one small step compared with what lies ahead. It would however 
  to be a mistake to assume that this is unavoidable. Not all information about 
  the future would become available to us; something's will remain unknown. (See 
  <a href="many_worlds.htm">Many Worlds</a> for my own predictions concerning 
  the limits to retro causal transmission of information.) Exactly what information 
  would become available in principle is not yet fullly understood. The concepts 
  of present and future would partly merge. There would be distinctions but not 
  as we know them today. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As soon as the time gate technology 
  becomes widely known, the rush will be on to retrieve information from the future. 
  Very quickly this will mushroom into a vast industry, the World will be gripped 
  by great excitement. It is hard, indeed impossible, for us to imagine accurately 
  what this will feel like. It will be an extraordinary period. The idea that 
  the future is coming within view will be an intoxicant for science, industry, 
  commerce and the military. This will be seen as the biggest idea ever.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">With thousands or in fact millions 
  of Time Gates opening up, we observe another key feature of retro-causality. 
  So long as advanced technical civilization exists, it will build Time Gates. 
  If the continuity of civilization is maintained unbroken information will continue 
  to be handed back over arbitrarily long intervals of time. We can infer that 
  rather a short time after the opening of the first Time Gates, an avalanche 
  effect will insure that we will start to receive information from further and 
  further into the future. The upper limit to the retro transmission of information 
  is set only by the longevity of that future technical society. We must hope 
  that this is explored in a similar way to the development of world wide web, 
  where openness comes first, and that vested interests do not try and block public 
  access to the new streams of information. This has the potential to be incredibly 
  enriching culturally to our society as a whole, we will depend on the goodwill 
  of society to insure this happens. The full potential of the time gates can 
  only be realised if they are not stymied by secrecy.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It is my prediction that in the event 
  the Cramer/Jensen experiment succeeds (or anyone else), there will be a pause 
  while others verify this work. There will be a further period while we search 
  really hard to find if there are any hidden factors preventing access to retrocausal 
  data. If no such restrictions are found, very shortly afterwards a great wave 
  of excitement will engulf physicists. The excitement will spread rapidly out 
  from the physics community and the race will be on to realise this dream. With 
  a prize this great, the intensity of activity would be unprecedented. Like the 
  Moon Race, it would be a great engineering feat, unlike the Moon Race, it would 
  not necessarily be centrally organised. There would be many different groups 
  and organisations all scrambling to get in on the action. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I cannot imagine anything more utterly 
  and totally extraordinary: the idea that I might live to, indeed within a short 
  number of years, be in a position to learn about the arts, culture, science, 
  technology, ecology, politics and history of our near and distant future. This 
  seems to belong to a realm of pure fantasy but no so. At the very least we have 
  brought this within the reach of hard SF and there is a non non-zero probability 
  that this is about to happen. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+3">Conclusion</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I have described how an experiment 
  to detect retrocausality maybe carried out in the near future. By Application 
  of the 'Asimov Daisy Chain' any small inverted time delay can be amplified by 
  a factor in excess of a million, extending from microseconds to minutes the 
  shift in time. By industrial scale development of vast numbers of 'Time Gates', 
  subject to sharing this information, the second level of amplification triggers 
  an avalanche of information arriving from all our future histories where Time 
  Gates are in use. What might start as a 50 microsecond inverted delay can grow 
  to a giant.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It is claimed that we live in the 
  post modernist era. Intellectuals argue over the definition of this term or 
  whether it really has meaning at all but no one can deny that the quality of 
  social change has altered and that arguably this is a new era. It may however 
  be but a brief interlude. It is my personal view that the rise of monetarism, 
  the power of global markets and the fear engendered by the war on terror have 
  temporarily overshadowed an underlying tendency for science to bring change. 
  The age that we called modernism was characterised by the dominance of engineering 
  and the physical sciences literally re-moulding society. The landscape was first 
  transformed by mechanised transport. Later the arrival of telecommunications 
  and computers provided enhanced access to information. Physics played a key 
  role in driving the engine of change. Along with the technical change came tolerance, 
  progressive politics and imaginative art and design. Today innovation continues 
  but physics to plays little direct part in it. The last time that fundamental 
  physics shook the world is now more than 60 years in the past. It appears that 
  following the devastating vision of nuclear war; physicists took a vow to detach 
  themselves from everyday life. This is far from true, some passionately argued 
  the importance of a social conscience and the need to evaluate the impact of 
  research but for most the question was simply not relevant. They had mostly 
  moved onto areas that had no conceivable application either in the near or longer 
  term future. They became involved with pure ideas, exploring the properties 
  of high-energy particles and in pursuit of a unification of all physical forces. 
  </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Physicists continue to influence 
  society with spin off developments, the world wide web was conceived at CERN, 
  the European centre for nuclear research by Tim Berners Lee. High energy research 
  is still very active with the completion of the LHC expected soon. While it 
  is true that the long sort after breakthrough in String Theory is not expected 
  anytime soon there is a new lively focus of research around quantum computing 
  and cryptography and it looks hopeful that some important breakthroughs of great 
  consequence maybe found. This research uses a mixture of different techniques 
  and the discovery of observer entanglement and the possibility of retro causal 
  communication comes directly from one of these areas of specialisation: quantum 
  optics.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Most physicists and serious intellectuals 
  would argue that ideas concerning time travel are wild conjecture and prefer 
  not to consider the subject. I suggest that there is good reason to reflect 
  upon this since even if the chances of a breakthrough are slim, the consequences 
  are so significant. Amongst cosmologists, Paul Davies and John D Barrow have 
  both recently put in writing that a breakthrough in time travel is possible 
  in the not too distant future. There are others in this field who hold the same 
  views and some who have even gone to the length of designing time machines, 
  all be it, only as thought experiments. Most famous for this is Kip Thorne whose 
  proposal for using a worm whole held open with exotic matter stirred up a huge 
  debate. Thorne's ideas are based on general relativity; a subject where others 
  had already proved a number of time machine like solutions to the equations 
  existed. Einstein with his strict adherence to the principle of causality would 
  have been unhappy about it, but the mixture of special and general relativity 
  combined with quantum mechanics creates a brew of paradoxes that more than likely 
  can only be resolved by accepting the reality of some sort of time travel.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If this change comes it will be the 
  single largest influence on society that science has ever brought. To my knowledge 
  no writer, either serious or fictional, has succeeded in reflecting upon the 
  true impact that knowledge of the future will bring. The subject is simply so 
  huge as to overwhelm. It has the potential to transform our civilization and 
  take us into an era as different as today is from the Stone Age. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I believe this transformation will 
  bring rich cultural rewards. While some will seek to exploit the new information, 
  ultimately the sheer volume of entirely new ideas will exceed any financial 
  or military aspirations. This will become a study of, and response to the arrival 
  of vast amounts of knowledge. Society will respond by encouraging and stimulating 
  learning, scholarship and much wider and deeper understanding; without this 
  the wealth of new information would arrive without being comprehended. It will 
  encourage diversity and will stimulate a move away from the monoculture brought 
  by consumerism. As a society we will become more responsible as we watch the 
  consequences of our actions over longer terms.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I will introduce a formalism to concisely 
  represent my conjecture concerning the impact of time technology. Following 
  the form introduced by Barbour who refers to the singularity within Platonia 
  that corresponds to the Big Bang as 'The Alpha Point' and the speculative cosmology 
  of Barrow and Tippler, wherein the point at which consciousness gains control 
  over all matter and energy in all logically possible universes as 'Omega'. I 
  now posit a third point that I shall call 'The Mu Point'. </font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><u>'The Mu Point' 
  occurs when consciousness, through application of retro-causal time communication, 
  gains objective knowledge of its future. </u></b></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There can be no mathematical 
  proof of the uniqueness of 'Mu'. There maybe numerous other civilisations elsewhere 
  in the universe who are on the way to or who have passed Mu. Our civilisation 
  may fall only to rediscover this knowledge later. Alternatively our civilisation 
  may endure and after we have passed Mu, we will find there is a clear view directly 
  to Omega. </font></p>

<H3>	Light is the closest we come to directly sensing the universal
energy. My intention is to make those who see my art aware of this energy 
and inspire them with a sense of awe and wonder.</H3> <P>

	In the past I divided my time between kinetic art and stage work. <P>
My stage lighting focused on electro-acoustic music culminating in a series 
of concerts in the mid 80's with the Electric Symphony Orchestra 
sponsored by Yamaha. 
</P>
These spectacular concerts were a carte blanche 
for me to expand my stage designs. The light shows created for these 
events were charged with the energy of rock music, but still maintained a 
distinct sobriety. <IMG SRC="../images/orches01.jpg" WIDTH=306 HEIGHT=230 HSPACE=16 VSPACE=16 ALIGN=right>

<P> The illustration on the left below is from the Almeida Festival in 1985.

The illustration on the left above  and on the right shows an ESO concert presented at the Queen Elizabeth hall at the London South Bank Arts Complex in 1986.
<P>
This was to be one of the last concerts I lit. I wanted to free myself from the restrictions of being 
under the control of a director so I decided to focus on kinetic art: a subject in which I could bring together my divided background and combine my knowledge of physics with my love of light.

	In 1983, at London's ICA, I exhibited the first sculptures to use
chromastrobic light, a discovery I had made the previous year. 
Chromastrobic light changes color faster than the eye can see, causing 
the appearance of rapidly moving forms to mutate in the most remarkable 
ways.

In this pair of illustrations you see maquettes made with black and white designs which change to bright colors when spinning in chromastrobic light.

	More recently I have concentrated on LIGHT SCULPTURE. In 1990,
I founded the Earth Signals group of artists. We exhibited together and I 
presented new kinetic sculptures which allowed beams of chromastrobic
light to play on strands of spinning string, their motion sensitive to the 
laws of chaos. These sculptures have a startling beauty as they create
delicate, changing, three dimensional patterns of light which float in the 
air.  An inspiration to enquiring minds, a scientific puzzle. How do these 
complex forms arise from something so simple? My work is gradually becoming
known internationally. In 1991, a mass produced item was launched based on
my light sculptures. Named String Ray,  30,000 were sold in USA.

In the film strip above you see 8 frames taken from the animation that is at the top of the page. There are big jumps in the shapes from frame to frame. When you see this in real life, the eye can see far more of these subtle changes than can be caught by the camcorder. Below right you see a stable form. Sometimes harmony takes over from chaos to produce a 'visual chord'.

In 1993 I 
was invited to exhibit at "Images du Futur", a major  annual exhibition of 
futuristic art held in Montreal.  I was given the largest space and exhibited 
the tallest work of art in the show, Big String, a 6 meter high light sculpture.   
<IMG SRC="../images/bt.jpg" WIDTH=221 HEIGHT=288 HSPACE=16 VSPACE=16 ALIGN=left>

In the summer of 1993 British  Telecom  commissioned a large 
fibre optic sculpture which was exhibited in the foyer of their head office 
in London, as part of the Art in the City project. 
Located a few hundred metres from St. Paul's Cathedral, at night time BT's vast atrium window was lit up with this strange 'burning bush'.
BT wished to show a work made with fibre optic as it was the new
telecommunication medium. 
<P>
This was the first project where I  used a computer control
system, utilizing a PC with a digital to analogue converter and an industrial 
digital servo system. Software was developed providing a graphic user 
interface which gave clear and precise control of the system parameters. 
This made it possible to program long and complex sequences of the  
light sculpture's activity without any repetition... organized chaos. 
	In 1994 my work was shown at The Light Fantastic exhibition in
Walsall, near Birmingham, England, a group show of a selection of British 
artists currently working in this field. A number of my sculptures were 
selected for 'Lichtspielereien'  a hands on exhibition at Technorama, the 
major science museum in Switzerland . Some of these works were 
purchased and are now on permanent display.<P>

	Technorama next commissioned  a large permanent 
installation for their new Textile section which opened in December 1995. 
Named The Light Spinner, this is an imposing interactive light sculpture
which stands  about 4 metres high at the front of the Textile Section of the
Museum. Using three 'strings' spinning between two large circular 
mirrors, one mounted on the floor and one suspended from the ceiling to 
create an 'infinite' tower of reflections. The illustration on the left shows the 
reflections, the right shows a close up.
<P>
<IMG SRC="../images/swiss2.jpg" WIDTH=166 HEIGHT=246 HSPACE=16 VSPACE=16 ALIGN=left>
           A touch screen computer is used to control The Light Spinner
with interactive and non-interactive modes. In the interactive
mode, at a touch of the screen, all three 'strings' can be changed to 
different colors in varying combinations of activity. Left alone the non-
interactive mode will start to control the sculpture automatically.  This 
enhances the eye catching quality of the work, insuring that there is 
always changing activity.<P>

	1995  also saw the completion of a smaller piece, Light Wave
Three, using the same control system as the Light Spinner. It is a free 
standing  sculpture 2.5 metres tall. It was first exhibited unfinished without a computer in Japan at Artec '95 in where I received a Recommendatory 
prize.  After completion it was shown here in England.<P>

	More recently using the computer programming language
Delphi, I have written a program, <A href="../text/zippage.html">Zip Art</A> which lets  you create surprisingly subtle and beautiful 
images and <A href="../text/visualmusic.html">Visual Music</A> using special drawing tools I have developed. Go to <A href="text/simpledraw2.html">Java Zip</A> to get a taste of what this is all about. Java Zip is an interactive Applet written in the internet friendly programming language, Java. You can try out a selection of the special drawing tools available with Zip Art.  On many of the Web site pages you will see small images made with it.
In the <A href="../text/gallery.html">Picture Gallery</A> you will find larger images drawn with Zip Art. I have in preparation a CD Rom with more information on my light sculptures, a complete working version of Zip Art and an interactive picture gallery with more  features and many more images than on the web site version. This will be available free of charge to museums and other commissioning bodies, please contact me for further  information.

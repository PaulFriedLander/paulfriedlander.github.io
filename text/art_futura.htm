        Wave Equation are the names I gave to the two major installations on show. 
        I chose a mathematical theme in honour of my father, F G Friedlander, 
        a Cambridge mathematician and fellow of the Royal Society. He died last 
        year. Waves were an abiding interest for him, as they have become for 
        me. The name of one of the installations is taken from the title of his 
        book, 'The Wave Equation on a Curved Space Time'. Extracts from the book 
        were projected into both the installations. The HyperSpheres were created 
        last year but I have now added an extra large HyperSphere and the data 
        projection in 3D. The Wave Equation was created specially for this show.</font>

      is influenced by science directly through the development of new technology, 
      but there are other important subtle ways science influences us. At the 
      core of scientific thinking are principles that are accepted as the basis 
      of many of our ideas. Although these are not easy to understand, they pervasively 
      influence our culture and the way we think as individuals. To understand 
      how we are being influenced, we need to understand these ideas and how they 
      are changing today. We find ourselves at the beginning of a new century, 
      the revolutions in thought from the last century now form the shoulders 
      upon which we must stand in order to see further into the future. </font>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Science grew out of 
        a rational inquiry into nature. During the 20th century, we came to understand 
        some of the limits to reason. We overthrew the dogma of the clockwork 
        universe, accepting relativity and uncertainty as fundamental. Towards 
        the end of the century, laws of chaos came to be developed. Alongside 
        these developments, theoretical physicists continued to hunt for a Theory 
        of Everything. Let us focus on this as it has been my greatest influence.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
        Theoretical physicist are broadly divided into three camps. The oldest 
        and most traditional have continued to work with the accepted theories 
        of physics and seek out new results from within this realm. Relativity 
        is now considered to be a classical theory together with all earlier physics. 
        Quantum mechanics is equally fundamental but separate and another foundation 
        upon which this work is built.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Since about 1980, 
        there has been a large group of scientists seeking a new theory to combine 
        relativity with quantum theory. Nobody knows quite what this will look 
        like, but it is referred to as 'The Theory of Everything'. Most of this 
        new research is involved with 'String Theory'. There are many different 
        versions, exploring exotic multi-dimensional geometry, and trying to find 
        how one dimensional objects, 'strings', would behave in these higher dimensional 
        spaces. They find that depending on the vibrations of these strings, they 
        can behave as all the known forces and particles. Thus each different 
        vibrating pattern of the same 'string' makes it behave as a different 
        particle. Recently M Theory has sought to provide a more coherent basis 
        for these various String Theories. </font><br>

      another smaller group of researchers investigating something they call 'Loop

        confusion amongst the experts, but strangely there is a growing consensus 
        on certain key issues. One of these, the Holographic Principle looks set 
        to become one of the most important ideas in this new physics. Debate 
        is still ongoing about what form this new principle should take and what 
        it signifies. I will end by quoting the physicist, Lee Smolin:<br>

          be described from the point of view of an observer who exists somehow 
          outside of it. Instead there are many partial viewpoints, where observers 
          may receive information from their pasts. According to the holographic 
          principle, geometrical quantities such as the areas of surfaces have 
          their origins in measuring the flow of information to observers inside 
          the universe.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Thus, it is not 
          enough to say that the world is a hologram. The world must be a network 
          of holograms, each of which contains coded within it information about 
          the relationships between the others. In short, the holographic principle 
          is the ultimate realization of the notion that the world is a network 
          of relationships. Those relationships are revealed by this new principle 
          to involve nothing but information. Any element in this network is nothing 
          but a partial realization of the relationships between the other elements. 
          In the end, perhaps, the history of a universe is nothing but the flow 
          of information.'</font></p>

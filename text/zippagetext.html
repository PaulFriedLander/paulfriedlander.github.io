<H1>Zip Art for Windows</H1>
<b> As an artist, when I first tried using computer graphics I had the impression 
that something was missing. Just as a word processor is a like a typewriter and 
filing cabinet combined, a typical graphics package is a drawing board, pens and 
airbrush. Very useful but the computer was not being used very creatively. I wanted 
to do something that used the full power of the computer and just looked magic. 
I decided to write my own software, Zip Art is the result. 
<p>
The new version is easier to use and once you start, you will soon be creating surprisingly subtle and beautiful images. Intricate forms appear effortlessly with each mouse movement, it looks like your computer has come alive! You can try an online version now by clicking  on <A HREF="javazip.html" TARGET="image"> Java Zip. </A>  After the Applet area turns grey and black again, click down with your mouse and draw on it. Notice how beautifully the colors are blended. 
<P>
Java Zip only shows you a hint of what is possible with Zip Art. If you download Zip Art you will have available 10 ready made color palettes, a color editor for creating your own color palettes, a choice of backgrounds and pen widths, literally hundreds of different drawing tools and numerous other special effects including animation. There are 2 animation demos, a tutorial and help files.

Easy to learn, intuitive and simple to use, you will progress from 
<A href="../gallery/hotsmile.html" TARGET="image">Fingerpaint</A> onto 
<A href="../gallery/alien.html" TARGET="image">Aliens</A> and
<A href="../gallery/bios.html" TARGET="image">Bios</A> 
 in a matter of minutes. You draw using a choice of special graphical tools. Each tool produces beautiful forms based upon mathematical algorithms, but the users needs to know nothing about the maths, which the computer carries out automatically "behind the scenes". The rich variety and subtlety of forms is "painted" onto the screen  with your mouse with which you control the size, shape and position of the patterns and merge them into one another. This is quite unlike any other drawing package on the market. It is not a method of filtering, morphing or modifying existing images with ready made textures and patterns. 
<P>
You are creating new pictures, interacting in real time with the computers "calculating engine".

Question:  Is this a toy or a serious graphical tool?</H2>

Answer:  </font>

Both, it is so easy 5 year olds will fall in love with it instantly, parents and teachers will realise how stimulating it is for the creative potential of their children. Adults who enjoy art will love it too. Anyone using Zip Art will be creating their own original images which they can print or save as bitmaps. 
<p>
For artists and graphics professionals, Zip Art offers a host of features enabling the rapid production of highly polished images which can be used 'as is' or exported to other software environments and seamlessly embedded into any number of other uses.

  seeking new forms.</BIG></font></P>
<FONT FACE="Arial"> 
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In this illustration, you 
  see a spinning string vibrating in harmony, this description sounds like a musical 
  instrument, but it is a light sculpture. The vibrating form is a superposition 
  of the second and fourth harmonic: a 'visual chord'. </font></P>
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">You can read more about 
  my light sculptures in <A HREF="../text/artbackgnd.html">Art Background</A>. 
  I am involved in developing light sculptures and new uses for the computer creating 
  'visual music'. </font></P>
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><BIG>Here is my understanding 
  of three kinds of visual music.</BIG> </font></P>
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><U>First Kind</u>: Visual 
  Music is a means of converting music to images using a system or set of rules 
  which can be implemented as a machine or computer code. There are screen savers 
  which respond to sound, but apart from synchronisation of sound and image, what 
  do they do? How can they express the content of the music? This idea has been 
  around longer that either the computer or the 'sound light converter' found 
  in night clubs. Some famous people have speculated about this, Goethe for one, 
  and Beethoven also was known to have produced a table of equivalence between 
  musical key and color. Beethoven and Goethe did not agree as to which color 
  corresponded to which key and the whole process of establishing a 'sound light' 
  relationship is an ongoing and unfulfilled activity.</font></P>
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><U>Second Kind</u>: Visual 
  Music is a means of expressing music in visual form requiring the active involvement 
  of an artist, designer or director to interpret the music and find the means 
  to express it visually. This is perhaps too narrow a definition since many of 
  the events and happenings of the 60s involved a collaboration between different 
  forms: theatre, dance music, etc. where no single element prevailed but the 
  performance was a kind of Visual Music. This is also where the word multimedia 
  originated. Rock videos could be said to fall into this category but the most 
  wonderful examples are more abstract and can be spell binding, awesome even. 
  The presentation of a Pink Floyd concert is a perfect example of this second 
  form .</font></P>
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><U>Third Kind</u>: Visual 
  Music has no relationship with music as such, although it maybe viewed with 
  or juxtaposed with music. Visual music is about creating visual relationships 
  which change over time. It is primarily about abstract qualities of movement 
  or changing form or color. This is the kind of visual music closest to my own 
  sensibilities, it is perhaps the most illusive or least understood form. The 
  earliest proponents used mechanical or optical means. The Whitney Brothers started 
  making what would now look like psychedelic (before the word had been invented) 
  animation's in the 50s and 60s. The first great creation of Visual Music to 
  receive widespread notice by the public was the Stargate sequence in the movie 
  2001. In the 70s, artists like Tom DeWitt and Richard Monkhouse started creating 
  special analogue electronic 'image synthesisers'. More recently with the advent 
  of desk top computers, there has been an explosion of activity in this area. 
  But much of this work is animation which is restricted by the fact that it must 
  have a beginning, middle and end. I prefer a form without time limits, where 
  you can watch for a minute or an hour, it all depends on your state of mind. 
  No beginnings, no endings, no fixed form, ever changing, every time you return 
  to the piece, something slightly different happens.</font></P>

<FONT FACE="Arial"> 
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Before I knew the term Visual 
  Music, with light, light shows and light sculptures I sought to dematerialise, 
  to render transparent and weightless, to create form without gravity, a floating 
  state, abstract, in short what I am here calling Visual Music. Most intriguingly 
  in my work with spinning string, I discovered forms that echoed the behaviour 
  of musical harmony. Intentionality is not my predominant artistic mode, we discover 
  through our work, only after the work 'speaks to us' do we understand our motivation. 
  The string 'spoke to me' and I understood my purpose in creating dematerialised 
  form. The vibrational forms of the string was the work 'speaking to me' but 
  what did it say? I am still interpreting its message but this is what I have 
  understood so far.</font></P>
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The term experimental is 
  used in art to indicate working with new forms. With the Spinning String Light 
  Sculptures I had found a much closer connection to the concept of experiment 
  in physics, I had discovered a new physical phenomena. </font></P>
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In science experiment is 
  used to test theory, but what then is my theory? It is that art is close to 
  science. You could simplify it by saying: physics is about physical forces, 
  art is about mental forces. More generally there is something deeper going on 
  in science and art. Einstein observed that a theory needs to be expressed elegantly. 
  A beautiful equation is more powerful because it can be worked with more effectively. 
  Its elegance gives it utility: Form follows Function was a founding principle 
  of modernism and although we live in a post modern age, the lessons taught by 
  modernists are still relevant, particularly when considered in the abstract. 
  This is not about style or functionality, at issue is the underlying common 
  nature of science and art. In this context, Visual Music throws 'light' on the 
  subject. </font></P>
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The observation that art 
  and science share a common purpose is not new, Leonardo DaVinci would have said 
  much the same and even at the dawn of history Pythagoras declared that numbers 
  were the underlying structure of everything. However this is not a matter of 
  repackaging classical concepts in a contemporary context. Our understanding 
  of the scientific method has undergone a paradigm shift within the last generation. 
  Science is no longer perceived as seeking immutable truths, its method uses 
  human imagination, searching for 'models', which explain and provide understanding. 
  Scientific theories (or models) may not resemble art works but they are creations 
  of the human mind and are subject of strong feelings within the scientific community. 
  While orthodox theories are taught 'as if true', new theories always come along 
  to upset the established truths in a way which mirrors the development of art. 
  This insight has yet to be fully appreciated by the scientific community, let 
  alone the World at large. It is important for artists to understand this, both 
  out of intellectual curiosity and because it is directly relevant to the their 
  own creative process. We are all engaged in a common creative pursuit.</font></P>

<FONT FACE="Arial"> 
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Pythagoras conviction that 
  the universe was made of numbers took its inspiration from music, but more than 
  that, it was a mystical revelation, of which I shall have more to say shortly. 
  The Greeks understood the principles of harmony and those principles remained 
  unchanged until the arrival of the tempered scale which was a revolution as 
  radical as Relativity overturning Classical Mechanics. In the 20<SUP>th</SUP> 
  century composers have used mathematical methods for a new purpose. They used 
  the formalities of maths to create a new kind of music which does not repeat: 
  "generative music". Terry Riley was an early exponent of this minimalist approach. 
  He came to London to perform his seminal work, 'A Rainbow in Curved Air' with 
  the Electric Symphony Orchestra, while I was their lighting designer. I find 
  Terry's approach to composition very close to my own intuitions about the way 
  I want to create visual music. </font></P>
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The use by artists and musicians 
  of science and mathematics is a step towards greater power. The purpose of science 
  is to explain and provide understanding but science is much more than a dry 
  process of reasoning, over and over again it has amazed us and transformed our 
  lives. For art to throw more light on the human condition this will be achieved 
  by a combination of passion and reason... although much of the reasoning may 
  be hidden in the finished artwork. Our eyes, minds and hearts will be opened 
  to the fullest by the new experience. The potential is there, we will be more 
  than surprised by the results. Unpredictable, but I hazard the guess that the 
  deepening fusion of art and science will not be artists in white lab coats, 
  quite the contrary, we shall be moved from disbelief to be overwhelmed and astonished 
  by the vision of the future that will unfold. </font></P>
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It is this sense of astonishment, 
  wonder, magic which remains central to my continuing activities as an artist. 
  I am a seeker in search of miracles. It is an abiding misunderstanding of our 
  age that there is some kind of contradiction or battle between art and science, 
  or science and religion. Far too many scientists have launched futile attacks 
  on the magical and irrational, too many evil technologies have been developed 
  from scientific discoveries. Too many people from what was once called the left, 
  the libertarians, the dreamers, the idealists in search of a better World have 
  denounced science. Don't be hasty in your judgement I ask. As artists and visionaries 
  we must rise above such skirmishes, and recognise the power and potential in 
  both the rational and magical. There has always been black and white in magic 
  and so it is with science and technology. It is up to us through our own experience 
  and understanding to discover the positive.</font></P>
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As children, we all have 
  an intuitive understanding of this magical aspect to life. Children are also 
  very good at asking questions. They are playful mystics and questioning scientists 
  all at once. It is this child like quality I seek to encourage within myself 
  and others. The sense of excitement is the fuel of imagination. Life can be 
  like a beautiful beach where we all play. The sea shells we find as children 
  are full of this energy. As artists our creations can absorb this energy from 
  our enthusiasm and concentration on the act of creation. If we are lucky, they 
  come to life, extra energy flows from an unknown source. It is then, when the 
  work itself surprises us that we know that we are really onto something. </font></P>

<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">With <A HREF="../text/zippage.html">Zip 
  Art</A> you can create Visual Music of the Third Kind ( or subtle and beautiful 
  static images.) You may find its means of recording and replaying your actions 
  limited but any one's first attempts to play an 'instrument' would be limited. 
  It is also my first experiment at creating a visual instrument with a computer. 
  It is much faster than conventional animation. If you want to improvise, this 
  is for you. There is spontaneity here and an interplay with chance.</font></P>
<P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The drawing tools are mathematical 
  algorithms incorporating sines and cosines. They are encapsulated so that the 
  user need know nothing about mathematics. Instead there is the 'magic' of not 
  selecting one color but a whole finely blended range which is painted onto the 
  screen. You are not limited to drawing a line but instead draw complex forms 
  which you control the size and proportions of with your mouse. Some of the illustrations 
  on this web site have been created with Zip Art, go to <A HREF="../text/gallery.html">Gallery

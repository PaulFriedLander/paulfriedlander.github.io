  <P><font color="#C0C0C0"><EM>My life was changed in a single day while I was 
    an undergraduate studying physics and mathematics. That day in 1970 I saw 
    one of the greatest exhibitions of kinetic and cybernetic art. I did not give 
    up my studies but I discovered a new passion. I began to create kinetic art.<BR>
    <BR>
    Amongst the artists whose work inspired me, one stood out, Nicholas Schoffer. 
    Many years later, I had the good fortune to meet Schoffer's widow. She still 
    lives in the studio where he worked in Paris and she has kept a large collection 
    of his work. I begin by showing photos from the studio and then show a selection 
    from the many works I have made over the years since. </EM></font></P>
  <P><font color="#C0C0C0"><EM>In 2006, I exhibited the Gate of Time in Milan 
    and shortly after Timeless Universe in Valencia. Reading &quot;The End of 
    Time&quot; by Julian Barbour has sparked my interest in time. I have reflected 
    deeply on the subject and concluded that there is something flawed about our 
    conventional understanding of the subject. In the final part of this talk 
    I will present research supporting the conjecture that it may be possible 
    to receive messages from the future. </EM></font></P>
  <P><font color="#C0C0C0"><EM>Our changing understanding of time begins with 
    Einstein's Special Relativity. With absolute time abolished, the concept of 
    'now' becomes ambiguous. John Wheeler and Richard Feynman added to the mystery 
    proposing a theory where light moves backwards and forwards through time. 
    More recently John G Cramer suggested that it might be possible to send signals 
    backwards through time. Most physicists are sceptical, but I have shown in 
    my own research that messages from the future do not lead to logical contradiction. 
    I challenge scientists to think again. If we try hard enough, I believe we 
    can sense the future.</EM></font></P>

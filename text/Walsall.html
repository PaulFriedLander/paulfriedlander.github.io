  WALSALL </font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> <img src="../images/walsallgallery.jpg" width="277" height="361" align="right" vspace="16" hspace="16"></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The New Art Gallery Walsall 
  is a world-class model of accessibility to the arts, where participation and 
  interactivity are fundamental. </font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This 
  £21 million building received one of the largest Arts Lottery grants outside 
  London and is already being hailed as one of the most exciting new art galleries 
  to be built in the UK in the last 20 years. </font></p>

  <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The very first exhibition 
  space visitors notice is The Discovery Gallery, located directly off the foyer. 
  Even before entering the building, the glass section of the front wall and the 
  glass dividing wall inside show a glimpse of this space. Prominent amongst the 
  exhibits is NAMBU, an interactive light sculpture commissioned for the gallery 
  which is permanently on show here.</font></p>

  of NAMBU</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Yoichiru Nambu is the Japanese 
  physicist who first proposed String theory in 1970. For the past thirty years 
  theoretical physicists have been intrigued by the idea that the ultimate constituents 
  of matter are not particles but a special kind of incredibly microscopic string. 
  According to this theory, all the normal constituents of matter we have already 
  learnt about like electrons and protons are all tiny strings in vibration. Depending 
  on the nature of the vibrations, they become different particles. String theory 
  says that there is ultimately only one kind of substance in the universe: String. 
  Everything we see or can detect with the finest scientific instruments are different 
  forms of this same string, everything in the world and all stars and galaxies 
  are made of these strings in various vibrations and associations with each other. 
  The problem for the theorist is that the strings are required to be so incredibly 
  small, far tinier still than atoms or elementary particles and quite beyond 
  the reach of being detected by any experiment which could be carried out within 
  the near or even distant future. They are so small that if a single atom was 
  expanded to the size of the entire observable universe, the strings of this 
  atom would be, well about the size of the sort of string we are used to, maybe 
  a few metres long. For now theorist continue to explore the idea, grappling 
  with hard mathematics but no one has found a way to prove that 'String' really 
  exists. </font></p>

<p><font size="+3">Python, tornado or eel?</font></p>
<p>by Ben Carlish</p>
<p>It looks like a 25- ft psychedelic tornado. Or a giant multi-coloured disco-dancing 
  python. Or even a Dulux-coated electric eel.</p>
<p>Part of the fun, Fallowfield-born Paul Friedlander's Wave factory sculpture, 
  is trying to decide exactly what it does look like.</p>
<p>The Wave factory, now at Upper Campfield Market Gallery on Deansgate is a rotating 
  rope suspended on a triangular frame with coloured strobe lighting fired at 
  it, so it constantly changes shape and colour.</p>
<p>Viewers can move their hands over infra red sensors to alter the speed of the 
  rope and the light filter.</p>
<p>&quot;A typical reaction of people when they walk in through the doors to see 
  the sculpture is to go 'wooh!' said 49 year old Friedlander, a graduate of physics 
  and fine art.</p>
<p>It puts people in touch with their child like qualities. They appear to display 
  youthful joy and it brings out a innocence not available in other pieces of 
  art.</p>
<p>&quot;There is a real mystery to it as well, sometimes the shape of the sculpture 
  becomes quite human.&quot;</p>
<p>The sculpure, part of the inter:face arts and technology exhibition, took Friedlander 
  15 years to develop. </p>
<p>He first had the idea when working in holographics in the States and tried 
  to create a 3-D hologram involving a skipping rope and a stroboscope.</p>
<p>He prototyped a tiny nine inch version to sell as a lava lamp like novelty 
  gift. Bill Parker, the man who marketed plasmas globes - the glass spheres with 
  static electric pulses flowing throught them - endorsed the mini sculptures. 
  But they sold only 30,00 and were dropped.</p>
<p>Friedlander then devoted his time to building it as a large art installation 
  using a search light-like-modulator, a computer programme, infra red sensors 
  and a 25-ft high carbon fibre frame.</p>
<p>He has not ruled out marketing the idae to the club scene and is already working 
  on his next project which will involve &quot;wave equations.&quot;</p>

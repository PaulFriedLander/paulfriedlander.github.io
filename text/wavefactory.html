      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The inspiration for 
        this work goes back to a time around 15 years ago when I was first thinking 
        about how to create 3D light projections. To this day a full solution 
        to this problem has never been found - holograms, stereo projections - 
        all of these techniques give an impression of 3d but never in the space 
        that we live in. I wanted to create real light sculpture which occupied 
        that space. </font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="../images/wavefactory2.jpg" width="338" height="494" align="left" vspace="8" hspace="16">After 
        experimenting with systems for projecting special light on various spinning 
        objects to create light sculptures, I found the perfect combination of 
        phenomena - I was experimenting with a series of very small pieces when 
        it crossed my mind that a skipping rope forms a transparent bubble around 
        the skipper. I thought I would try and make a small skipping rope driven 
        by electricity - my first experiment was just a length of string, barely 
        a foot long, and two model motors. To my amazement, the very first moment 
        I switched this device on I saw an extraordinary range of wave patterns 
        far more intriguing than just the simple skipping shape I was expecting. 
        Depending on the speed and the amount of slack in the rope the patterns 
        vary from harmonic, rem</font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">iniscent 
        of the oscillating strings of musical instruments, through to changing 
        and chaotic patterns. Between these extremes patterns emerge with strangely 
        almost humanoid form, suggesting the shape and movements of a dancer.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I have lit these kinetic 
        forms with a variety of high intensity light sources. Most notably I have 
        used chromastrobic light - light which changes colour faster than the 
        human eye can see. This appears white, but contains a mixture of colours, 
        generally created by spinning a colour wheel at high speed in front of 
        the light source. A static object looks unchanged by the light, but an 
        object moving at high speed leaves multi coloured trails of light floating 
        in the air behind it. Thanks to the persistence of vision, the chromastrobic 
        light shows its colours when shining on these moving objects. W</font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">hen 
        the objects is a string or rope, the resulting forms then become magically 
        transformed turning this simple element into a multi coloured light sculpture.</font></p>

        Wave Factory is the largest piece I have exhibited in Britain. </font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The light illuminating 
        the sculpture is a custom designed searchlight using a 2.5 kw HMI lamp, 
        a 35" diameter fresnel lens and a computer controlled light modulator. 
        I developed the software using the programming language Delphi. The program, 
        as well as providing interactivity, will automatically change the light 
        sculpture when its senses nobody is trying to interact with it. I have 
        adapted the principles of generative music to create a sequence of changes 
        which is not random but never completely predictable. The movement is 
        created by spinning the nylon rope with a servo motor mounted in the top 
        of the framework. The speed is controlled by the computer.</font> </p>

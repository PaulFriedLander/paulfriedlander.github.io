<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I am told my first word was car. 
  There never really was any doubt that I loved movement and machinery, but this 
  direction must have been clearly cemented in my mind by the earliest major experience 
  of my life, visiting USA for 6 months. My father, Gerard Friedlander, was a 
  mathematician, a junior lecturer at Manchester University at the time. He was 
  offered a chance to spend six month doing research at New York University in 
  1954. I was two years old when I left and I returned thoroughly converted to 
  the joys of all things big and mechanical. I remember the ship we sailed in, 
  The Queen Mary, I remember standing on the quay with its vast dark presence 
  beside me. In New York, it was the sky scrapers and the building sites, especially 
  the excavators. I could not quite get my tongue around this word which I pronounced 
  'enterbator', and of course the cars. My dad drove a Dodge. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Shortly after returning to England, 
  my father was offered a more senior post at Cambridge, which is where he ended 
  up spending the rest of his academic career, going onto become a Fellow of the 
  Royal Society. The best thing I remember about Cambridge as a small child was 
  having an enormous garden which I would spend long hours down absorbed in my 
  own fantasy world. The first time I understood about news on TV I was six years 
  old. This was the beginning of the space age and the Russians had put Sputnik 
  into space. I remember hearing the eerie electrical sound of its radio signals 
  returning to Earth. I was totally in love with rockets and space travel. I dreamed 
  that when I grew up I would invent a way to fly to the stars, build my own spaceship, 
  and fly off by myself. In my garden, I constructed my own first attempts, made 
  out of odds and ends, but in a funny sort of a way, looking back now, I see 
  that this where I began to find the sculptor in me.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> I was far from a conventional child. 
  I am sure my school mates considered me strange. I had no interest in sports 
  or team activities of any kind and looked different. As soon as the Beatles 
  came out, I discovered music, which previously had been completely meaningless 
  to me. Within months I started to grow my hair long. I was to become a rebellious 
  teenager. In those days, England was mostly still very conventional. Those of 
  us who dared to be different had to put up with the taunts of others. People 
  would jeer at me in the street, shouting 'Is it a boy or a girl?' My unusual 
  appearance caused problems at school, but I am glad to say my parents stood 
  right behind me, defending my right to be different. They were in their own 
  more reserved way unconventional themselves. My mother, Yolande Friedlander, 
  was an artist, and although my father was an academic, he never liked the college 
  life and the obsession with tradition which is so much part of that ancient 
  city. To him it seemed totally illogical, and contrary to the spirit of pursuit 
  of new ideas. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">At secondary school I excelled at 
  physics and mathematics. Although I had shown some talent in art, I really considered 
  this a minor pursuit at the time. While still dreaming of space ships, I turned 
  my attention to cosmology. That seemed a subject worth pursuing: the theory 
  of the universe. At that time there were two competing ideas: the Big Bang Theory 
  and The Steady State. I preferred The Steady State. I judged it much more logical. 
  I did not like the idea that the universe could have begun only relatively recently 
  in an incomprehensibly large explosion. I much preferred the notion of eternity. 
  The universe was eternally old. There was no beginning and there would be no 
  end. I still hold to that view but the history of cosmology turned another way, 
  The Big Bang came to dominate, so by the time I arrived at university, I had 
  some misgivings about following this direction, knowing that 'my' theory was 
  losing out. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Shortly after arriving at university, 
  ( I was reading physics and maths at Sussex), I went up to London for the day 
  to visit an art exhibition. I had always visited art exhibitions since I was 
  a small child. My mother would take us as children to see the visiting shows 
  of contemporary work which regularly came to the small Arts Council gallery 
  in Cambridge. What I was to see on that fateful day in London was no small exhibition. 
  The show 'Kinetics' at the Hayward Gallery in 1970 was to change my life. I 
  was totally in rapture from the experience. There were numerous marvelous pieces 
  by all the leading kinetic artists. The work that struck me as the finest was 
  by <a href="http://www.olats.org/schoffer/">Nicholas Schoffer</a>, a french 
  cybernetic artist. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I came away from the show convinced 
  that I knew now what I wanted to do with my life. I wanted to create kinetic 
  art. I set about this without delay. I became enthusiastically involved in making 
  kinetic works in my spare time. Very soon I found myself spending more time 
  making art than working on my studies. I set up a simple workshop in my house 
  and found a new way to live. Every morning I would get up and attend lectures. 
  These would generally all be over by lunch time. In the afternoon, instead of 
  going to the library to study, I would come home and work on my kinetics. I 
  considered dropping out but chose to stay, although I am sure my studies did 
  suffer as a result of my new found passion. Something of the scientific method 
  rubbed off on me and I have never lost my love of science. I was particularly 
  lucky at Sussex to to have as personal tutor, Anthony Leggett, a brilliant physicist 
  and expert on quantum mechanics at low temperatures. He subsequently received 
  the Nobel prize for work on superfluids.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">After graduating, I chose to continue 
  my studies, taking a degree in fine art. My mother had died by then, and I am 
  very grateful to my father who continued to support me and give me encouragement 
  in pursuing my new direction. I went to Exeter Art College, which turned out 
  to be a disappointment. I hated the prevailing attitude in the art world. The 
  teachers struck me as being fickle and often not very intelligent. My passion 
  for my work continued but I was challenged now about what direction my career 
  could take. There was apparently no interest in the art world for beauty. This 
  was considered out of date, passe. Nothing could be worse than to be labeled 
  passe and kinetics was rapidly going out. The big new thing was conceptualism. 
  I came to consider the art world as some kind of strange fashion following cult. 
  Members of the art world all shared the same views, talked nonsense and froze 
  out any one who dared to consider their own talent more important than following 
  what every one else was doing. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Arriving in London in 1977 after 
  having finished all my studies, I found the most fabulous studio to work and 
  live in. It was a huge old warehouse down by the river Thames next to Tower 
  Bridge called Butler's Wharf. There were already about 150 artists there tucked 
  into this warren of atmospheric old buildings. My place was on the waterfront, 
  up on the fourth level, with great big double doors opening out over the quay. 
  Despite this auspicious piece of luck in finding this wonderful place, I was 
  really not sure what to do next with my life. I had fallen out of favour with 
  the art world, and could not yet see where else to apply my talents. I decided 
  to try developing some commercial products which I could licence to manufacturers 
  in the entertainment industry. I was very naive in commercial matters. Although 
  I took out a provisional patent on the idea, I was easily tricked by the company 
  to whom I showed my invention. They pretended to have only a vague interest 
  in what I was doing and then said they did not wish to pursue the matter. In 
  reality they were busy behind my back, creating their own new lighting effect, 
  inspired by what I had shown them. They were clever enough not to exactly copy 
  what I did, so I could not easily take them to court, but I have no doubt that 
  about what happened. Today there are numerous products on the market which all 
  owe their origin to the prototypes I had created back then. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A couple of years passed and when 
  one day, an old acquaintance phoned up and asked if I would like to be the lighting 
  director for a theatrical production, I jumped at the chance. The show was called 
  'The Warp', directed by Ken Campbell and written by Neil Oram. A 23 hour long 
  cycle of plays to be performed with only brief intervals through the night and 
  most of the following day, twice a week for three weeks at the Edinburgh Festival. 
  This was 1979, and from then on I found myself drawn deeper into a world of 
  very eccentric people. The Warp was an autobiographical play concerning an English 
  mystic and nearly guru. It told the story of the life of a man who had started 
  out in the beat era, inspired by poetry and jazz, gone onto experiment with 
  drugs, particularly LSD, then turned to scientology, before heading off to India 
  in search of enlightenment. Eventually ending up back in the UK, living in Scotland 
  in a remote farm house he squatted on the shores of Loch Ness. Here he gathered 
  around him a gang of seekers after knowledge. Some of these people went on to 
  become members of the cast of the play, whilst a good proportion of the other 
  actors, if not actually friends of the author were of a similarly mystical outlook. 
  </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I was never in any doubt about what 
  I thought about such movements, but whilst I considered the ideas expressed 
  to be nonsense, I found myself strangely drawn to the people. They seemed to 
  have more sensitivity, more humanity, than the rest of the population. I was 
  now in a kind of limbo state. </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I 
  was neither a believer, nor was I straight. I had no interest in joining these 
  strange movements, nor could I imagine where I could go next in life. What actually 
  happened was more down to earth. I met someone, started a family, had two wonderful 
  children, Naomi and Jack, and was completely devoted to them. Whilst the children 
  were small, they took up most of my life. I continued to do stage lighting, 
  but it was not an important part of my life. It was just something I did.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Deep down I was unsatisfied. My unconscious 
  would not let me be at peace. There was something burning in me and it had to 
  get out. I had a mission in life that I was failing to pursue it. My family 
  life suffered, my relationship ended, and then I decided I could no longer stand 
  doing stage lighting. I did not want a director telling me what he wanted. I 
  wanted to decide what I wanted. I did my last professional stage lighting design 
  in 1987. By then I had become known as a leading designer of lighting for avant-garde 
  music. The last show was for the Electric Symphony Orchestra at Sadlers Wells 
  Theatre. It was a good show but not my best. I was ready to move on. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Luckily I already had some ideas 
  tucked away I had been working on for some years. Little maquettes, kinetic 
  pieces, mostly no more than a few inches high crudely made out of electric motors, 
  light bulbs and other bits of this and that. I had for some time been thinking 
  about the problem of three dimensional projection. It had started out with a 
  wish to create some kind of 3D projection which occupied the space we lived 
  in. I had seen holograms, tried stereoscopic glasses and was unimpressed. These 
  things felt like illusions. The 3D was never real enough. I wanted something 
  that was simply there, in the room with me, not solid, but translucent, made 
  of light, luminous, and capable of changing. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Although these experiments were simple, 
  I made two important discoveries. I discovered the chaotic properties of spinning 
  string and chromastrobic light. I will not repeat a description of these phenomena 
  here since they are well described elsewhere. What is important for you to understand 
  that whilst I had focussed on my family and stage lighting, these ideas had 
  languished in the back room. Now I decided it was time to focus on them. I built 
  a small collection of sculptures, put together a group of artists interested 
  in Chaos and organised an exhibition on that theme. This was the summer of 1990. 
  Chaos was really 'in'. For once I was in fashion. It may have been a small show 
  in a tiny gallery, but now I was getting written about, I appeared on TV. This 
  began to feel like something was happening. I was not selling work. The art 
  connoisseurs were not yet interested, but I was making waves. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">About this time I received an invitation 
  to attend a conference at the Massachusetts Institute of Technologies Institute 
  of Advanced Visual Studies. I had always wanted to go there. This is a mecca 
  for hi-tech artists so this was an opportunity not to be missed. The conference 
  called Art Transition '90 was to prove a transition for me. It was now almost 
  twenty years since I had first been so inspired by kinetic art and throughout 
  all that time I had never lost my fascination for the subject, yet I had been 
  so distracted by other pursuits that I had spent only a small part of those 
  years following my interest. This conference coming hard on the heals of my 
  recent show in London set me clearly on a path which I have followed ever since. 
  No longer would I divide my time, I must live for my art. As luck would have 
  it, amongst the other delegates, was a man already well skilled in commercialising 
  art, Bill Parker, the inventor of the plasma ball. He loved my work from the 
  first moment when he set eyes on it and offered to give me an introduction to 
  the company who were manufacturing his product. For a while it looked like I 
  was set to make a fortune. I flew off to Hong Kong and was put up in great luxury, 
  all on the company expenses. A licence agreement was quickly signed and a product 
  followed. Unfortunately USA was going into one of its many recessions at that 
  time. No sooner was the product on the market than it was withdrawn again. Even 
  though 30,000 pieces had been sold, it was not selling as well as the company 
  had hoped. The company themselves were in trouble and they too went out of business 
  shortly afterwards. I sold several more commercial licences around that time 
  but I was not destined to make a fortune that way. None of my other designs 
  went into production and I soon found myself again concentrating on creating 
  art for arts sake. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 1993, I was asked to do my first 
  large commission for British Telecom at their HQ in the City of London. I was 
  also invited to exhibit at Images du Futur in Montreal, where despite being 
  a previously unknown, I was given the largest single exhibition space of any 
  of the artists. My reputation for working on a big scale had arrived before 
  me. Not many sculptors can claim to make really large sculptures. I can, and 
  that really got noticed. Receiving the commission as well was a double success 
  because that meant I was beginning to sell the work as well. Since that time, 
  I have gradually found my reputation spreading further and further. You can 
  find a full list of my major shows and commissions in my professional 
  CV. I have received various prizes and won competitions. Most recently I 
  have been listed in Who's Who for 2002. My most memorable experience was Lightforms 
  '98 in New York. Today I have reached a point where I have to turn down offers 
  I would like to accept simply because there is not enough time to do everything.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I still see myself on a mission. 
  </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So far I have exhibited my 
  light sculptures on numerous occasions but not much has been seen of my computer 
  art. I have been a late starter in this field. I taught myself to program in 
  1996, learning the computer language, Delphi. My first achievement, Zip Art, 
  I wrote within a matter of weeks of starting to program: it was initially intended 
  as a learning exercise, but the project took on a life if its own. It has proved 
  the most popular software I have written, thousands have copies of it have been 
  downloaded from my website and unknown number of pictures drawn with it. You 
  can find a copy of it on this CD. My primary goal was writing software to control 
  light sculptures. This is the major part of my computer art, but I continue 
  to write software which generates graphics. I do not use conventional graphics 
  or animation. I prefer to write code. Recently I have used OpenGL and an example 
  of this can be found on my website under Las Vegas. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">My long term goal remains the full 
  integration of the light sculptures with computer art leading to the creation

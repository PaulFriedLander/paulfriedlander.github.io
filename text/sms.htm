      permanent installation was commissioned by SMS, a UK based company specialising 
      in satellite data links. The light feature is custom made to fit into a 
      small space resembling a lift shaft located by the entrance to the recently 
      completed new wing of the building. The room is approximately 2.5 metres 
      square in floor area and 5 metres tall. The treatment of the surroundings 
      walls was carefully designed to create the appropriate atmosphere. An illusion 
      of great height is achieved with a circular mirror attached to the ceiling 
      and another on the floor. The mirror in the picture below has a hole, approximately 
      0.35 metres in diameter cut in the centre to allow a concealed light to 
      shine through. The light installation is not open to the public. </font></td>

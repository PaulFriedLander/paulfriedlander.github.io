        to the opening night of the Resonant Wave Festival were treated to many 
        activities, amongst these a surprise that even the organisers knew nothing 
        about. Japanese Butoh dancer, Atsushi Takenouchi, was inspired to perform 
        naked under the Manifold Wave sculpture.</b></font></p>
      <p><b><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF">As 
        creator of the light sculpture, I was sitting quietly beside the work, 
        when I was surprised to see the dancer, Atsushi, step gingerly onto the 
        mirror that forms the base of the sculpture. He proceeded to astonish 
        an audience of several hundred who had already been spell bound by their 
        first viewing of my new light sculpture.</font></b></p>

        rope used to create the display is suspended below an immensely powerful 
        arc light, which has been custom built as an integral part of the sculpture. 
        In the picture, the rope and servomotor have been removed. You can see 
        a wheel below the large lens, which is used as a pulley to moderate the 
        speed of the motor. The rope is attached to the wheel. </font></b></p>

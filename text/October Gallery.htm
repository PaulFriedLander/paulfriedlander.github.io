      the foyer of the October Gallery was completely redesigned and transformed

    <td><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I named the work <i>Chromatoforms</i>, 
      word play on the term chromatophore, an organ possesed by cephelapods: squid, 
      octopus and cuttlefish. This enables them to change colour at will, not 
      only as a camouflage but as a means of communication. These apparently lowly 
      invertabrate show surprising intelligence. I chose this slightly obscure 
      subject knowing that the October Gallery is home to another remarkable charity, 
      The Planetary Coral Reef Foundation. It has has been sailing the oceans 
      monitoring the state of marine life for many decades, and their never ending 
      journey has been conducted in a concrete sailing ship, the<i> Heraclitus</i>, 
      built by the founders of the gallery.</font></td>

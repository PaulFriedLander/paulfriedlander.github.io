In the summer of 1993 British  Telecom  commissioned a large 
fibre optic sculpture which was exhibited in the foyer of their head office 
in London, as part of the Art in the City project. 
Located a few hundred metres from St. Paul's Cathedral, at night time BT's vast atrium window was lit up with this strange 'burning bush'.
BT wished to show a work made with fibre optic as it was the new
telecommunication medium. 
<P>
This was the first project where I  used a computer control
system, utilising a PC with a digital to analogue converter and an industrial 
digital servo system. Software was developed providing a graphic user 
interface which gave clear and precise control of the system parameters. 
This made it possible to program long and complex sequences of the  
light sculpture's activity without any repetition... organised chaos. 
	In 1994 my work was shown at The Light Fantastic exhibition in
Walsall, near Birmingham, England, a group show of a selection of British 
artists currently working in this field. A number of my sculptures were 
selected for 'Lichtspielereien'  a hands on exhibition at Technorama, the 
major science museum in Switzerland . Some of these works were 
purchased and are now on permanent display.<P>

	Technorama next commissioned  a large permanent 
installation for their new Textile section which opened in December 1995. 
Named The Light Spinner, this is an imposing interactive light sculpture
which stands  about 4 metres high at the front of the Textile Section of the
Museum. Using three 'strings' spinning between two large circular 
mirrors, one mounted on the floor and one suspended from the ceiling to 
create an 'infinite' tower of reflections. The illustration on the left shows the 
reflections, the right shows a close up.

           A touch screen computer is used to control The Light Spinner
with interactive and non-interactive modes. In the interactive
mode, at a touch of the screen, all three 'strings' can be changed to 
different colours in varying combinations of activity. Left alone the non-
interactive mode will start to control the sculpture automatically.  This 
enhances the eye catching quality of the work, insuring that there is 
always changing activity.<P>

	1995  also saw the completion of a smaller piece, Light Wave
Three, using the same control system as the Light Spinner. It is a free 
standing  sculpture 2.5 metres tall. It was first exhibited unfinished without a computer in Japan at Artec '95 in where I received a Recommendatory 
prize.  After completion it was shown here in England.

	In 1996 using the computer programming language
Delphi, I have written an application, <A href="../text/zippage.html">Zip Art</A> which lets  you create surprisingly subtle and beautiful 
images and <A href="../text/visualmusic.html">Visual Music</A> using special drawing tools I have developed. Go to <A href="text/simpledraw2.html">Java Zip</A> to get a taste of what this is all about. Java Zip is an interactive Applet written in the internet friendly programming language, Java. You can try out a selection of the special drawing tools available with Zip Art.  On many of the Web site pages you will see small images made with it.
In the <A href="../text/gallery.html">Picture Gallery</A> you will find larger images drawn with Zip Art. I have in preparation a CD Rom with more information on my light sculptures, a complete working version of Zip Art and an interactive picture gallery with more  features and many more images than on the web site version. This will be available free of charge to museums and other commissioning bodies, please contact me for further  information.

<h2>Ars Electronica 2018</h2>
<h4>  It's a long scroll/stroll down, please continue</h4>

<div>Set in the depths of a former war time bunker,  initially converted to a postal sorting office,  subsequently to be partly abandoned  and turned over to use as an occasional arts centre. <a href="https://ars.electronica.art/news/" target="_blank">Ars Electonica Festival</a>  is at POSTCITY, Linz ( and other venues) Linz, Austria, September 6-10. It is the world's largest festival of electronic arts and this year featured works by over a thousand artists.</div>
<div><img src="../../images/2018_ArsElectronica/4279.jpg" width="100%" vspace="24" /></div>
<div>POSTCITY is almost like a castle, visitors enter by climbing a ramp and crossing a bridge to  find the welcome desk and the first of the hundreds of exhibits awaiting them. Alongside the artworks, the  great parcel and letter sorting machines are  all still standing there, like a vast sculptural installation, with  rows of spiral chutes big enough for a person to slide down (and yes you are allowed!) and conveyor belts long since turned off and static,  stretching off into some indefinite distance. It is only after wandering this maze for who knows how long past numerous fascinating exhibits they will find their route drawn downwards and entering into an almost endless narrow corridor, which finally discgorges them into the darkness of the windowless basement bunker level below. And once they have made this journey, the next corner they turn brings them to a room which has become temporary home to part of the BEEP Electronic Art Collection.</div>

<div>The bright new member of the collection, a dancing waveform, partly surrounded by a group of circular mirrors takes centre stage. By now those who know my work will recognise the characteristic fascination with kinetic  colourful waveforms, this installation explored new limits to how chaotic they could become, at times tangling, ah but I had not told you the theme for this years Ars Elctronica festival was Error, and I was totally in the flow.</div>

<div>But before you leave take note of the heavy concrete form quietly standing over to one side</div>

<div>
  <p>The dancing wave is just one half of a larger installation called Tycho Test One.  The concrete is a new experimental material with optic fibres embedded into it, the first ever of its kind to be fabricated in Spain. In future it will become more transparent and the fibres more richly textured in their quality. The concrete was manufactured by <a href="https://www.escofet.com/" target="_blank">Escofet</a> as part of a collaboration organised by the <a href="https://www.newartfoundation.org"  target="_blank">NewArtFoundation</a>  in association with <a href="https://eurecat.org/"  target="_blank">Eurecat</a>, a Catolonia based group of industrial companies. This is the first in a series of  pieces created through my winning the ATA fellowship for collaborations of industry with an artist.

<div>Production for the exhibition was provided by <a href="http://laagencia.org/" target="_blank">La Agencia</a> with special thanks to Arturo Garrido for development of early ideas on the concrete form, Jaime de Los Rios for engineering, Jordi Llacer for design,  Sandro Castillo and Vicente Matallana for production.

<div>How the name 'Tycho: Test One' was chosen:
</div><div><img src="../../images/black_space.jpg" width="400" height="24" /></div>
<div>The  shape of the fibre optic concrete was chosen to be a large        monolithic flat slab. This reminded me of the monolith that is        featured in the movie 2001. It was literally the first slab of        this size ever made from this material, hence Test One. According        to the movie the monolith is encountered by astronauts on the Moon        hidden in the crater called Tycho. Tycho is the name of the        greatest astronomer of the 16th century who worked diligently to        disprove Copernicus making the finest observations without        telescopes and just before their invention. His results were        eventually to prove the opposite, and it was his assistant Kepler        who found the first mathematically elegant description of a sun        centered solar system. So his life's work was based on an error,        the theme of this years Ars Electronica. In choosing the specific        elements of the installations, I imagined the 'Dancing Wave' as a        counterpart to the then mysterious movement of the planets, the        mirrors as the observational equipment and the great monolith as        the means to record the observations. 'Lux Aerterna', composed by Gyoorgy Ligetti is the        soundtrack in the scene in the movie where we are first shown the        monolith in the crater Tycho, and is playing in the background to the installation.

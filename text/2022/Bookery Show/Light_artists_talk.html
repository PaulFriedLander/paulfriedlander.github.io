<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Iona Scott will talk about her work</font> Discosphaera.</p>
<p>Discosphaera Tubifera is a type of phytoplankton - incredible tiny lifeforms, invisible to the human eye and yet responsible for producing approximately 50% of the oxygen on our planet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Through her Plankton Light Sculptures, which are linked to a virtual representation of their magical world, Iona Scott invites you to learn more about the importance of phytoplankton through visual and sensory experiences, guiding you on a seamless and mesmerising journey from our world, through the threshold, into the submarine realm.</p>

Paul Friedlander will talk about his recent shows
in England and  Sweden. </p>
<p>You will see glimpses of wild party goings on at the Warm Up festival 
  in a not so wild forest in Hertfordshire, the famed Shambala festival at 
  its secret site in the midlands, a beautiful Island of Light off the 
  wild west coast of Sweden and the art museum in  Boras, a city otherwise known for its textile industry close to G&ouml;teborg.</p>
<p>He will end with a performance of  hand held colour light waves. </p>
<p>There 
  will be time for questions and answers afterwards.</p>

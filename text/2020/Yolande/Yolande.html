<h2 align=center>Art by Yolande Friedlander (1914 - 1967)</h2>
<p align=center> My mother was an artist, I recently rediscovered most of these paintings while going through posessions stored  by my sister. Sadly even while she lived much of this work, far from being appreciated, got consigned to the garage and only now have I brought it back to the light of day. Some  are damaged, some I remember and strike strange emotions in me as I have not seen them since I was a small child and she would have been painting them.</p>

    <td>This dark image with a black form within a figure I suspect my mother painted at some point after she got her cancer diagnosis, which was in her mid 40s. At some point later in her illness, she largely gave up painting but continued with ceramics and print making. (To be documented later) This painting is particularly badly damaged by mould, white and orange speckles.</td>

I looked up the name in Google, it says: Many believe it to mean &quot;sea of bitterness&quot; or &quot;sea of sorrow.&quot; However some sources cite the alternative definitions of &quot;rebellion&quot;...and &quot;mistress or lady of the sea.&quot; She was indeed the wildest character on the street, growing tired of her bank manager husband, she allegedly took first a male lover and then a woman, sub dividing the house and settling down with her new lesbian partner, while her husband was confined to his quarters upstairs.</td>

This must have been a happy and tranquil time.</td>

      Rock is held annually in the small town of St Brieuc. This festival is mostly 
      popular music but includes a selection of many artforms, including theatre, 
      street performance and digital arts. I was the only visual artist showing 
      at this years festival. The exhibition was at La Passerelle, the large venue 
      in the centre of town.</font></td>

      <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
        exhibition was held in a darkened room. It was very popular with a constant 
        crowd watching the light sculptures.The sculptures were susupended from 
        the ceiling at a height of about five metres. </font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
        visuals were accompagnied by sounds created using remarkable software 
        that converts images to sounds. It had long been my wish to reverse the 
        process of making lights respond to sound and this show was the first 
        to achieve this goal using software called the Voice. Originally developed 
        as an aid to the blind, you can read more about this at their <a href="http://www.seeingwithsound.com%20">website</a>. 
        Many thanks to Joost Rekveld, organiser of Sonic Light, for originally 
        drawing my attention to this software, and many thanks to its creator, 
        Peter B.L. Meijer, for giving permission for using it.</font></p>
